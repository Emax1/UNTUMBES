The impact of e-commerce in supply chain management on permanent establishment concept;Information and communications technology (ICT) in supply chain management has enabled corporations to use offshore facilities for outsourcing commercial activities. This has expanded service trade significantly but poses challenges for tax authorities. This article deals with one of the important issues - the supply chain management in E-commerce and taxation industries and the Permanent Establishment rule which mean is any fixed place of business of the employer and includes a branch, a mine, an oil well, a gas well, a farm, timberland, a factory, a workshop, a warehouse, an office and an agency. This article examines issues surrounding the (1) rapid expansion of global electronic commerce in the context of supply chain management, (2) extant theory of taxation, (3) policy considerations and (4) e-commerce in the context of taxation. Based on the examples, this article explores the effective methods of supply chain management in the E-commerce industry, creates a taxonomy of recommender systems, including the interfaces they present to customers, the technologies used to create the recommendations, and the inputs they need from customers. © 2019.
Product recommendation for e-commerce business by applying principal component analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering: benefit for the society;Recommender system is a computer-based intelligent technique which facilitates the customers to fulfill their purchase requirements. In addition to this, it also helps retailers to manage the supply chain of their business and to develop different business strategies keeping in pace with the current market. Supply chain management (SCM) involves the streamlining of a business’s supply-side activities to remain competitive in the business landscape. Maximizing the customer value is another important activity of SCM to gain an advantage in the market. In this work, the K-Means clustering algorithm has been used for the effective segmentation of customers who have bought apparel items. PCA has been used for dimensionality reduction of different features of products and customers. The main focus of this work is to determine the different possible associations of customers in terms of brand, product, and price from their purchase habits. The result shows that the clusters made by the algorithm based on PCA and K-Means are similar and the results are acceptable on the basis of feedback received from existing customers and satisfies the customers’ requirements based on the amount of money (price range) the customers want to spend while doing online shopping. The features of products purchased by customers were combined together to generate a unique product key for business, and a model was prepared to segment products based on the volume of products sold and revenue generated, and the price of products sold and revenue generated. This work, in the long run, will help business houses to build a sustainable, profitable, and scalable e-commerce business. Environmental, social, and economic aspects are important to make e-commerce more sustainable for the benefit of the society. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.
The Application of Personalized Recommendation System in the Cross-Regional Promotion of Provincial Intangible Cultural Heritage;With the accelerated trend of globalization and modernization, many provincial intangible cultural heritages (PICH) are in danger of being lost. In the context of Internet technology, the use of digital multimedia for personalized recommendation is an effective way to promote the transmission of intangible cultural heritage. However, traditional recommendation systems tend to treat different members as homogeneous objects, ignoring the relationship between members' professional backgrounds and the inherent properties of items, and cannot truly solve the problem of conflicting preferences in the integration process. In view of this, this paper proposes a group recommendation system based on nonnegative matrix decomposition. First, the group rating information is decomposed into a user matrix and item matrix by nonnegative matrix decomposition. Then, the item affiliation matrix and member expertise matrix are calculated by using the affiliation and expertise weights for the two matrices, respectively, and the contribution degree of each member to different item ratings is obtained from them. Finally, the group preference model is constructed by weighted fusion of members' preferences based on their contribution degrees, and different recommendation lists are generated for different user preferences. The experimental results prove that this system has high recommendation accuracy in cross-regional promotion of PICH.  © 2022 Qin Wang.
INTERNET OF THINGS ENABLED ELECTRONIC MARKETS: TRANSPARENT, COLLABORATIVE, AND AUTOMATED;The rapid and successful evolution of the electronic markets is enabled by information and communication technology (ICT) tools such as recommender systems, reputation feedback systems, product reviews and ratings, peer-to-peer payment mechanisms, and parametric search functions. In recent years, the Internet of things (IoT) has connected billions of devices around the world to collect and share data on product and process performance, physical surroundings, and usage patterns. These IoT-based smart objects have a profound impact on three core business processes: product lifecycle management (PLM), supply chain management (SCM), and customer relationship management (CRM). Drawing on the theories in the fields of ICT-led electronic markets and IoT applications, this paper shows how IoT can transform the next generation of electronic markets by making them more transparent, collaborative, and automated. The paper contributes to the theory of the electronic markets by showing how the IoT can extend the product life cycle management beyond the firm's boundaries, enable live tracking of the product in upward and downward supply chains, and provide proactive customer relationship management (CRM) services. The challenges faced by electronic markets during such transformation are also discussed. © 2020 Issues in Information Systems. All rights reserved.
Recommendations from cold starts in big data;This paper examines the challenging problem of new user cold starts in subset labelled and extremely sparsely labelled big data. We introduce a new Isle of Wight Supply Chain (IWSC) dataset demonstrating these characteristics. We also introduce a new technique addressing these challenges, the Transitive Semantic Relationships (TSR) model, which infers potential relationships from user and item text content and few labelled examples. We perform both implicit and explicit evaluation of TSR as a recommender system and from new user cold starts we achieve a hit-rate@10 of 77% on a collection of 630 items with only 376 supply-chain consumer labels, and 67% with only 142 supply-chain supplier labels, demonstrating a high level of performance even with extremely few labels in challenging cold-start scenarios. TSR is suitable for any dataset featuring few labels and user and item content, where similarity of content indicates similar relationship forming capability. TSR can be used as a standalone recommender system or to complement existing high-performance recommender models that require more labels or do not support cold starts. © 2020, The Author(s).
Joint Matrix Factorization: A Novel Approach for Recommender System;Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most classical method for recommender system, but it is usually suffered from limited performance by the sparseness of user-to-item rating data. Recently, due to the powerful learning feature representation ability, deep learning components are used to leverage auxiliary information to assist recommendation. However, most existing models based on deep learning are incomplete so that merely extracting the item latent representation and ignoring the user parts. Besides, different data are not chosen from current models. This paper proposes a novel probability framework, named as joint matrix factorization (JMF). There are three components in JMF. Firstly, the modified multilayer crossing version of the factorization machine (MFM) is designed to extract the user latent factors based on user behavior information. Moreover, MFM is a general method which can be used to accomplish many tasks in terms of machine learning. Secondly, a modification of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), named as bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM), is used to extract the item latent factors of a document sequence from both front and back directions. Finally, we tightly integrate BLSTM and MFM into probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) to form JMF. Compared with the classical matrix factorization and other integration models, JMF extracts document data as well as user behavioral data as item vectors and user vectors. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets show the proposed model has better performance compared with the state-of-the-art recommendation methods.  © 2013 IEEE.
Recommender systems as an agility enabler in supply chain management;In recent years, recommender systems have become necessary in overcoming the challenges related to the incredible growth of information. They are used in a wide range of contexts and applications, mainly as prediction tools for customer interest, designed to help customers decide, compare, discover and explore products (Meyer in Recommender systems in industrial contexts, Sciences et Technologies de l’Information, Grenoble, 2012). Therefore, research in the field has focused on improving the efficiency of data processing for instant and accurate recommendations. Recommendation of products, accordingly, does not take into consideration supply chain constraints for deliveries. This can lead to recommendations for products that can be costly or too long to ship to the customer, resulting in an avoidable increase in the stress on the supply chain. This paper addresses the problem of considering delivery constraints in product recommendations. The objective is to shift demand toward products that can be delivered using the current network state without additional resources in a given time window, perimeter and with a minimum acceptable profit, in the context of e-commerce. To achieve this goal, we propose a methodology to adjust product recommendations in order to shift customers’ interests towards particular products with consideration for remaining unit loads of scheduled deliveries. For this, quasireal-time information about the supply chain is taken into consideration to improve the number of shippable products in the recommendation list, resulting in a possible improvement in truck-load utilization, lower operation costs and reduced lead-times for delivery. This method works in two stages: the first stage is the computation of the recommendation with traditional recommendation systems, and the second stage is recommendation adjustments in four phases that consider the evaluation of active trucks, evaluation of physical constraints for transportation, evaluation of the profits associated with adding a pickup/delivery to a scheduled tour for each recommended item and adjustment of recommendation scores. A sensitivity analysis of the impact of the recommendation adjustment on the recommendation list has been conducted for each of the parameters considered in the proposed method: time window, perimeter radius and minimum acceptable profit. Various experimental results prove that the method permits increasing the number of recommended products that can be shipped using the available resources within a given perimeter radius, time window and minimum profit. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.
A vendor recommendation model using neural networks;Suppliers today are considered as a logical extension to a firm that provide critical inputs to its processes. Supplier performance evaluation is vital for any firm to carry out supplier selection and to practice effective supply chain management. Further, the supplier performance measurement system should continuously evolve in a company as a process for improving the capabilities, execution effectiveness and efficiency. Though the supplier performance systems have been well investigated in the literature, very few studies have proposed an order-based supplier selection approach that takes into account the changing priorities of the customer. The research tries to address this gap by attempting to establish a dynamic linkage between customer order priorities and supplier characteristics. A neural network model for the order driven vendor recommendation system that ranks the suppliers as per the requirements of the order has been proposed. © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.
A Meta-Analysis on the Determinants of Online Product Reviews with Moderating Effect of Product Type;The technological advances in digital space have provided a renewed impetus for business to expand their footprint across digital modes. The growth of the internet and the ease of its access to the masses has encouraged many businesses to go online. Online e-commerce platforms make it easy to search, locate and place orders. Technology-assisted supply chains and fast delivery mechanisms ensure that users don't have to go elsewhere to fulfill their needs. To earn loyalty and customer satisfaction, e-commerce platforms have evolved into a sophisticated recommender system. It has evolved from just an informational source to a participative mode where users can share their experiences about their purchases. Customer values other user experiences more than the information provided by the seller. The presence of many conflicting and contradicting reviews can make the task of making rational decisions difficult for many users. Many studies were performed to understand what constitutes a review helpful and came up with different or mixed outcomes. The present study reviews the factors that influence online customer reviews helpful. Meta-analysis was performed to reconcile the mixed findings of different factors of online review helpfulness. The meta-analysis found that with the moderating effect of product type, factors like review length, readability, rating, reputation, and expertise positively correlate with helpfulness. Further, the customer finds moderate reviews more helpful in terms of polarity. Meta-analysis has a mix of findings for the selected data points in the study. The mixed findings include product type (search, experience, or other) and helpfulness measurement criteria. © 2022 Kavita Rawat and Sunita Kumar.

Sonia: An integrated indonesia online tourism system in new normal era;Indonesian travel and tourism have grown to become one of the largest economic sectors in the world. Tourists are the main source of income for gross domestic income in Indonesia. However, although Indonesia as a beautiful archipelago country has so much offer to foreign and local tourist, until now it fails to give their potential to the country. Furthermore, the COVID-19 situation made Indonesia tourism worse. Travelling is banned as a consequence of lockdown in Indonesia. Business and economic need to adjust into their new normal. Unfortunately, in the midst of the current era of Internet technology and new normal, Indonesia’s tourism promotion is considered to be uneven and unwell targeted. Many tourist destinations are very interesting and clean but not yet known by potential tourists both from domestic and abroad due to the lack of targeted promotions and re-branding of a safe place to visit. Seeing to this prob-lem, this study aims to propose an integrated tourism system called SONIA, by using a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to build a personalized recommender system. Through this system integration model, a significant socio-economic benefit can be made for tourism sector in Indonesia. The results of the research will be exploited for the tourism industry and Indonesia’s participation in the global tourism competition market. © 2020, ICIC International. All rights reserved.
Unified route representation learning for multi-modal transportation recommendation with spatiotemporal pre-training;Multi-modal transportation recommendation aims to provide the most appropriate travel route with various transportation modes according to certain criteria. After analyzing large-scale navigation data, we find that route representations exhibit two patterns: spatio-temporal autocorrelations within transportation networks and the semantic coherence of route sequences. However, there are few studies that consider both patterns when developing multi-modal transportation systems. To this end, in this paper, we study multi-modal transportation recommendation with unified route representation learning by exploiting both spatio-temporal dependencies in transportation networks and the semantic coherence of historical routes. Specifically, we first transform the multi-modal transportation network into time-dependent multi-view transportation graphs and devise a graph-based contextual encoder to impute the missing traffic condition in transportation networks by leveraging various contextual factors. Then, we propose a hierarchical multi-task route representation learning (HMTRL) framework for recommendations, including (1) a spatiotemporal graph neural network module to capture the spatial and temporal autocorrelation, (2) a coherent-aware attentive route representation learning module to explicitly model route coherence from historical routes, and (3) a hierarchical multi-task learning module to differentiate route representations for different transport modes by incorporating multiple auxiliary tasks equipped in different network layers. Moreover, to improve the model generalization capability, we further propose spatiotemporal pre-training strategies to exploit rich self-supervision signals hidden in transportation networks and historical trajectories. Finally, extensive experimental results on two large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system against eight baselines. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.
Research on collaborative recommendation of dynamic medical services based on cloud platforms in the industrial interconnection environment;With the rise of industrial interconnections, deep cross-border integration between different medical industries has begun. In the context of industrial convergence, the users’ medical business needs also show a trend of diversification and personalization. The phenomenon of multi-service resource crossing and multi-organization information barriers in the traditional medical supply chain lead to a lag in the medical resource recommendation time, which makes medical enterprises face the problem of reducing the efficiency of information resource flow in industrial interconnection businesses. This study thus constructed a collaborative recommendation model of medical services based on a cloud platform by mining the characteristics of dynamic medical service resources and user demand, and used a singular value decomposition algorithm based on time context to solve the model so as to achieve reasonable recommendation of dynamic multi-service resources in the medical supply chain. The results showed that the proposed collaborative recommendation model of dynamic medical business resources based on the cloud platform can effectively achieve medical business recommendations and provide ideas for reducing the operating costs of medical enterprise alliances under the condition of industrial interconnection and improving the efficiency of industrial resource interconnection. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.
Design a novel approach for electronic product;E-Commerce websites are the major emerging trends in the current scenario, which facilitates online product selection, purchase and sales. Nowadays E-commerce websites have better popularity and advent nature, so numerous count of users wish to share their opinions about their experience in the form of making reviews, ratings and blogs. Each of the first four of these goals can be realized through recommender systems: ¨ ``Customize services around standardized products and services'': Recommender systems provide a customized service that enables E-commerce sites to sell their largely commodity products more efficiently. ¨ ``Create customizable products and ser vices'': Recommender systems are a customizable product of the E-commerce site. ¨ ``Provide point of delivery customization'': The recommender system directly customizes the point of delivery for the E-commerce site. ¨ ``Provide quick response throughout the value chain'': We predict that recommender systems will be used in the future to predict demand for products, enabling earlier communication back the supply chain. © IJSTR 2019.
Context-Aware Interactive Knowledge-Based Recommendation;Recommender systems have widely been used in the past few years as a recipe to success in e-commerce. Already, 35 percent of what consumers purchase on Amazon and 75 percent of what they watch on Netflix come from product recommendation (MacKenzie et al. in How retailers can keep up with consumers. Technical report. McKinsey & Company, London, 2013). However, in the context of high-end products such as cars, computers, apartments, or financial services, traditional approaches are not the best choice since it is infeasible to collect enough customer behavioral information or feedback over numerous items (Burke et al. in Ai Mag 32:13–8, 2011). Accordingly, since brick and mortar outlets remain the channel of choice for those kinds of products, recommender systems need to adjust to a context in which inventory and customer information are limited. To achieve this goal, we propose a context-aware interactive knowledge-based recommendation to make recommendation to customers who walk into a store, even when no previous information about the customers is available. This technique works in 3 stages: stage 1, contextual pre-filtering, stage 2, interactive exploration and stage 3, constraint-based recommendation. The methodology was developed with an industrial partner in the domain of sport vehicles and is illustrated step by step with an example inspired from this partnership. The proposed method enables an iterative exploration of the products in-store, creates a learning base to learn customers’ interests and recommends a suitable product with regards to logistics, contracts and product’s availability in the network. The method has been tested on our industrial partners’ data and validated by domain experts. This work is a step toward the creation of a continuously evolving learning base of customers’ interests that can be used to adjust sale’s strategy and to develop new products, designs and features that better meet the ever-changing demand of customers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.
ANALYSIS OF E-COMMERCE USABILITY AND SECURITY FACTOR BASED ON MULTIMODAL BUSINESS DIMENSION IN PHARMACEUTICAL SUPPLY CHAIN AND CBIR BASED TEXTILE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM;"The usability testing is a complex procedure with many components for those wishing to improve their websites' usability to the fullest. There is no rocket science involved; all you need to know is some basic assumptions. The most obvious one is that if you want your website to be fantastic, you must test. The key usability issues that are pertinent to e-commerce websites are linked to the trouble spots during the purchasing process. Consequently, the following inquiries are covered by the exam objectives: Is it simple for customers to locate the items they need? Do they have access to enough information to make a well-informed purchasing decision? What challenges arise? A carefully defined aim would have a quantifiable outcome to be attained (such as work completion rate, duration, accuracy, etc.), a particular. In this hypothetical article, a theory that hasn't been confirmed is presented, and usability testing and security testing are briefly contrasted. Despite the absurdity of making comparisons between these occupations, the result is surprising. Testing may not be as different between usability and security as it first seems. More research on usability testing may yield fresh security testing ideas. © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved."
"Automated digital cause-and-effect diagrams to assist causal analysis in
problem-solving: a data-driven approach";"Causal analysis is an integral part of product quality problem-solving
(QPS). Quality management within the manufacturing industry has
generated a considerable amount of QPS data; while this implies a
historical and extensive body of QPS experience, these valuable
empirical data are not being fully utilised. Therefore, the current
study proposes a method by which to mine know-why from historical
empirical data, and it develops an approach for constructing digital
cause-and-effect diagrams (CEDs). The K-means algorithm is first adopted
to cluster the problems and causes. The random forest classifier is then
selected to classify cause text into the main cause categories, which
manifest as `rib branches' in the CED. Based on the clustering and
classification results, we obtain an abstract cause-and-effect diagram
(ACED) and a detailed cause-and-effect diagram (DCED). We use the
quality data of an automotive company to validate the method, and we
additionally undertake a pilot run of the Fishbone Next system to
demonstrate how users can obtain these two CEDs to support causal
analysis in QPS. The results show that the proposed approach efficiently
constructs a digital CED and thus provides quality management
problem-solvers with decision support to derive the potential causes of
problems, thereby improving the efficiency and effectiveness of their
causal analysis initiatives."
"Traffic channeling under uncertain conversion rates on e-commerce
platforms";"Traffic is the lifeblood of every e-commerce platform. The question of
how to channel traffic to merchants operating on a platform lies at the
heart of platform management. We consider a platform on which two
independent merchants sell their products. Merchants compete on
inventory in the sense that some of the unmet demand at one merchant
will spill over to the other. The platform channels traffic based on
products' conversion rates to maximize the total sale on the platform.
We show that traffic channeling plays three roles. First, it allows more
efficient allocation of traffic; that is, the merchant with a high
conversion rate is given a higher priority in receiving traffic. Second,
it allows the platform to control demand spillover between the merchants
to maximize total sales. The platform either facilitates or prevents
demand spillover, depending on product substitutability. Third, traffic
channeling intensifies competition between the merchants and hence
increases the total inventory. More efficient allocation of traffic and
the increase in inventory increase sales inequality between the
merchants. In contrast, demand spillover decreases sales inequality.
While the platform always benefits from traffic channeling, the
merchants do not benefit when their products are moderately
substitutable. Interestingly, when the two products are owned and sold
by the same merchant, the opposite happens-traffic channeling always
benefits the merchant but may hurt the platform. Our study provides a
basis for informed discussions on how platforms should channel traffic
in response to conversion rates, and how traffic channeling affects the
welfare of merchants and platforms."
"Safemedchain - drug counterfeit prevention and recommendation using
blockchain and machine learning";"Counterfeit drugs are without a doubt becoming a greater hazard to
consumers and the pharmaceutical sector. As a result, real-time
visibility of drug manufacturing and management is required. The
proposed system uses Ethereum blockchain as the main technology. The
primary advantage of blockchain technology is that the transactions are
maintained in immutable digital ledger format and it may be read easily
without jeopardizing the users security and privacy. In our proposed
system, the admin validates and adds the manufacturers. The manufacturer
after registering and logging in can perform tasks like adding the drug
and seller list. The seller can place order to the manufacturer which
the manufacturer can accept or reject. The seller can update status of
order of accepted orders to delivered. The customer can view the order
details by entering the serial number on the drug package. Any
transaction or exchange that occurs in the network is recorded in the
chain. It functions similarly to other networks, but blockchain
technology is distinguished by the fact that no data can be removed or
altered by anyone in the network. No changes to the network can be made
unless it has been validated by all of the networks authorized users.
All the information stored can be read by anybody so to incorporate more
security, AES has been used to store data in the blockchain. The use of
AES encryption technique distinguishes this system from all the existing
implementations. Thus, this makes it easy to trace to the exact point in
the supply chain and detect any counterfeit drugs in movement. As an
extension to the drug counterfeit prevention system a Drug
Recommendation System is also performed using the ensemble model with a
combination of Random Forest and Logistic Regression for sentiment
analysis training. Furthermore, when compared to the existing Linear SVM
model, which has an accuracy of 90.39\%, the suggested model has the
best accuracy of 93.31\%. Using the obtained sentiment for each drug,
the drug is predicted accurately for the specified medical condition."
"Sentiment analysis of public services for smart society: Literature
review and future research directions";"Businesses use sentiment analysis for market insights to improve
performance. Sentiment analysis application in building a smart society
is immense, and there is a need to delineate the trend holistically. The
present study addresses the research gap by a comprehensive bibliometric

implications are provided."
"An integrated recommender system for improved accuracy and aggregate
diversity";"Information explosion creates dilemma in finding preferred products from
the digital marketplaces. Thus, it is challenging for online companies
to develop an efficient recommender system for large portfolio of
products. The aim of this research is to develop an integrated
recommender system model for online companies, with the ability of
providing personalized services to their customers. The K-nearest
neighbors (KNN) algorithm uses similarity matrices for performing the
recommendation system; however, multiple drawbacks associated with the
conventional KNN algorithm have been identified. Thus, an algorithm
considering weight metric is used to select only significant nearest
neighbors (SNN). Using secondary dataset on MovieLens and combining four
types of prediction models, the study develops an integrated recommender
system model to identify SNN and predict accurate personalized
recommendations at lower computation cost. A timestamp used in the
integrated model improves the performance of the personalized
recommender system. The research contributes to behavioral analytics and
recommender system literature by providing an integrated decision-making
model for improved accuracy and aggregate diversity. The proposed
prediction model helps to improve the profitability of online companies
by selling diverse and preferred portfolio of products to their
customers."
"Prediction Method of Short-Term Demand for e-Commerce Goods Based on
Deep Neural Network";"In order to improve the short-term demand prediction effect of
e-commerce commodities, this paper combines the deep neural network
algorithm to predict the short-term demand of e-commerce commodities and
proposes a nonparametric supply chain demand prediction model based on
multilayer Bayesian network. Moreover, this paper uses the hidden layer
factor to describe the internal relationship of customer demand in time
series and uses the bottom layer factor to represent the actual customer
demand. In addition, this paper directly takes side information into
consideration to improve the accuracy of customer demand prediction.
Through simulation experiments, it can be seen that the prediction
method of short-term demand for e-commerce goods based on deep neural
network is close to the actual demand, and it can play a certain role in
the demand prediction of e-commerce goods."
"Implementation of Digitalized Technologies for Fashion Industry 4.0:
Opportunities and Challenges";"The Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations prioritize
sustainability by 2030. The fashion industry is one most substantial
manufacturing industries that generate an economy of 3 trillion dollars
and contributes to 2\% of the world's gross domestic product. In
addition to this, the fashion industry must focus on social and
environmental concerns, where it should create fashionable products to
promote sustainable consumption and production. Sustainable consumption
and production can be achieved with the establishment of resilient
infrastructure with innovation. The resilient infrastructure with
innovation is realized by the integration of digital technologies such
as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI),
blockchain, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR). With this
motivation, this study explored the different studies that implemented
these technologies in the fashion industry for smart cloth (health),
supply chain, circular economy, dress recommendation system, fashion
trend forecasting, health prediction, and virtual and augmented based
shopping experience. Along with the progress of these technologies in
the fashion industry, the study also discussed limitations and provided
recommendations such as wide adoption of blockchain in fashion supply
chain; advancement in energy storage for smart cloth; integration of
IoT, AI, and edge computing; and smart clothing-based framework for
rescue operation for future enhancement."
"Generating decision support for alarm processing in cold supply chains
using a hybrid k-NN algorithm";"Real-time temperature monitoring is necessary in cold pharmaceutical
supply chains (SCs), where exposures to extreme temperatures can lead to
product quality deterioration. Temperature alarms (TAs) triggered by the
current rule-based systems still require lengthy examinations before a
suitable corrective measure (CM) can be chosen. However, provision of
additional information relevant to TAs can expedite the examination
process. In the related areas of recommender systems and false
alarm/anomaly detection, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm has proven
to be successful because of its interpretability and ease of use.
However, in the context of TA processing, it may suffer from some
inherent limitations (i.e., varying neighborhood radius, unreliable
classifications in sparse and noisy regions, and blindness to natural
class boundaries). To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid
k-NN (Hk-NN) algorithm based on the principles of local similarity and
neighborhood homogeneity. It incorporates a two-step voting procedure
with an entropy-optimized k-NN radius, decision trees with k-constrained
leaves, and nearest neighbor predictions. We investigate 16,525 comments
by alarm personnel for TAs in a pharmaceutical SC and encode them in
terms of deviation causes and CMs (target features). We use SC data on
cargo location, SC phase, sensor role, and temperature characteristics
as predictor features for TA similarity estimation. In eight
experimental setups, HkNN consistently outperforms k-NN with an
optimized k in terms of accuracy, balanced accuracy, macro-average
precision, recall, and specificity. At the same time, Hk-NN refrains
from predicting observations, for which kNN's accuracy is close to a
random guess."
"Analysis of Precision Service of Agricultural Product e-Commerce Based
on Multimodal Collaborative Filtering Algorithm";"The times are advancing, the Internet is constantly advancing, and there
are many examples of the combination of technology and life. The way
people buy agricultural products is no longer limited to the physical
market, but is being transformed into an agricultural product e-commerce
website to achieve digital transformation. So far, a large number of
agricultural products have been collected on the agricultural product
e-commerce website, they come from all over the country, and different
types and different regional agricultural products have appeared. On the
other hand, users are faced with a large number of commodities on the
Internet. If they simply use search engines, consumers need to spend a
lot of time to find the commodities they are interested in by browsing.
Searching from the recommended ones greatly reduces the product set and
optimizes the performance of the e-commerce platform. Therefore, the
generation of the personalized recommendation system meets the needs of
the market. This research will improve the related recommendation
algorithm by improving the user similarity calculation method based on
artificial intelligence technology, improve the execution efficiency and
accuracy of the improved algorithm, and use related technologies to
develop an agricultural product e-commerce recommendation system. It has
important theoretical and practical significance to save users' browsing
time, improve users' shopping experience, and speed up the construction
of agricultural product e-commerce."
"Improving Sales Forecasting Accuracy: A Tensor Factorization Approach
with Demand Awareness";"Because of the accessibility of big data collections from consumers,
products, and stores, advanced sales forecasting capabilities have drawn
great attention from many businesses, especially those in retail,
because of the importance of forecasting in decision making. Improvement
of forecasting accuracy, even by a small percentage, may have a
substantial impact on companies' production and financial planning,
marketing strategies, inventory controls, and supply chain management.
Specifically, our research goal is to forecast the sales of each product
in each store in the near future. Motivated by tensor factorization
methodologies for context-aware recommender systems, we propose a novel
approach called the advanced temporal latent factor approach to sales
forecasting, or ATLAS for short, which achieves accurate and
individualized predictions for sales by building a single tensor
factorization model across multiple stores and products. Our
contribution is a combination of a tensor framework (to leverage
information across stores and products), a new regularization function
(to incorporate demand dynamics), and extrapolation of the tensor into
future time periods using state-of-the-art statistical (seasonal
autoregressive integrated moving-average models) and machine-learning
(recurrent neural networks) models. The advantages of ATLAS are
demonstrated on eight product category data sets collected by
Information Resources, Inc., where we analyze a total of 165 million
weekly sales transactions of over 15,560 products from more than 1,500
grocery stores."
Getting value from artificial intelligence in agriculture;"Artificial intelligence (AI) is beginning to live up to its promise of
delivering real value, driven by recent advances in the availability of
relevant data, computation and algorithms. In the present paper, I
discuss the value to agriculture from AI over the next decade. The more
immediate applications will be to improve precision information about
what is happening on the farm by improving what is being detected and
measured. A consequence of this are more accurate alerts to farmers.
Another is an increased ability to understand why phenomena occur in
farm systems, so as to improve their management. From improved data and
understanding come improved predictions, enabling more optimal decisions
about how to manage farm systems and stimulating the development of
decision support and recommender systems. In many cases, robotics and
automated systems will remove much of the need for human decision-making
and improve farm efficiencies and farm health. Artificial intelligence
will also be needed to enable organisations to harness the value of
information distributed throughout supply chains, including farm data.
Digital twins will also emerge as an important paradigm to improve how
information about farm entities is organised to support decision-making.
There are also likely to be negative impacts from AI, such as disruption
to the roles and skills needed from farm workers, indicating the need to
consider the social and ethical impacts of AI each time a new capability
is introduced. I conclude that understanding these challenges more
deeply tends to highlight new opportunities for positive change."
"A DNN-Based Cross-Domain Recommender System for Alleviating Cold-Start
Problem in E-Commerce";"Many applications use recommender systems to predict user preferences,
improve user experience, and increase the amount of sales. However,
because of the cold-start problem, it is not easy to recommend items to
new users accurately. Recommendation performance degrades in the case of
users with little interaction, in particular latent users who have never
used the service. To alleviate the cold-start problem, we develop a
framework that combines an online shopping domain with information from
an Ads platform. Our framework employs deep learning to build a
cross-domain recommender system based on shared users in these two
domains. This is the first attempt that models users based on shared
users in online shopping and Ads domains for solving the user-cold start
problem. We apply Word2Vec to turn textual information on users and
items into latent vectors as their representations. The experimental
results show the effectiveness of deep neural approaches with knowledge
transferred from another domain for the cold-start problem. Textual
information may contain useless information, and Word2Vec cannot capture
some structural and semantic correlations between different users.
Therefore, we propose R-metapath2Vec to enhance user modeling and use
the Stacking model to integrate these two kinds of user representations.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
integration model: our framework can recommend products to users of
another domain through Ads distribution in a more accurate level."
Neural Session-Aware Recommendation;"Recommender systems help users find items they are likely to interact
within the near future, such as products to buy in e-commerce or songs
to play in music websites. The Traditional recommendation methods make
predictions based on long-term user profiles, i.e., the items a user
interacted with in the past while ignoring the time and order of the
interactions. Recent findings, however, suggest that users may exhibit
interest to items in a certain order depending on situations and more
recent items in a sequence have a larger impact on the subsequent
choices. Moreover, in many practical applications, user-item
interactions are organized into short sessions, where each session
reflects the user's short-term interest in addition to long-term
preferences. Leveraging both long-term user profiles and short-term
sequential patterns from sessions can lead to more accurate models known
as the session-aware recommendation methods. In this paper, we explore
various strategies to integrate user long-term preferences with session
patterns encoded by recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The strategies
include integrating user embeddings with input and output of session
RNNs, integrating with fixed or adaptive contributions of the user and
session components by using a specially designed gating mechanism. We
conducted an empirical evaluation of three publicly available datasets.
The results indicate that combining user long-term profiles with the
output of session RNNs yields improved predictions and the proposed
adaptive integration model outperforms the state-ofthe-art sequential
and session-aware recommendation methods."
"Cooperate or not? Strategic analysis of platform interactions
considering market power and precision marketing";"In order to increase market share and enhance business competitiveness,
comprehensive retail platforms (CRPs), such as Taobao.com and JD.com,
are currently cooperating with social service platforms (SSPs), such as
TikTok and Meiyou. Therefore, more research attention needs to be paid
to such platform supply chains. To this end, this study develops
stylized models to explore the impacts of the market power of an SSP and
the precision marketing of a CRP on platform cooperation. Our major
research findings include the following. First, we investigate the
equilibrium strategy and find that if the CRP's commission rate is low
(high), cooperation becomes the equilibrium strategy when the SSP's
market power is low (high). Second, in most cases, market power will
affect the equilibrium strategy with a change in the commission rate.
However, in a certain range of commission rates, the equilibrium
strategy remains unchanged. That is, market power has an ``invalidation
effect{''} on the equilibrium strategy. Finally, we find that as the
commission rate increases, precision marketing reduces the willingness
of supply chain members to implement platform cooperation. However, when
the commission rate is low, precision marketing stimulates cooperation
between platforms. The study results provide guidelines for improving
the cooperation between CRPs and SSPs."
"Customer models for artificial intelligence-based decision support in
fashion online retail supply chains";"Fashion is a global, multi-trillion dollar industry devoted to producing
and selling clothing, footwear, and accessories to individuals or groups
of people. Its sheer numbers, together with social and environmental
sustainability concerns, and the move towards digitalization of
customer-centric operations, make the fashion business a prime target
for Decision Support Systems (DSSs). On the other hand, decision support
in fashion retail is particularly problematic and embraces all major
supply chain domains. Decisions in an online fashion retail supply chain
(FRSC) are highly dependent on time-varying customers' preferences and
product availability, often leading to a combinatorial explosion. To
address such a problem, DSSs could greatly benefit from high-quality
information stored in customer models (CMs), constructed by using
Artificial Intelligence techniques, allowing informed decisions on how
to personalize (adapt) to match the customer's needs and preferences.
Combinations of CMs with recommender systems (RSs) have been
increasingly utilized in fashion e-commerce to provide personalized
product recommendations. Nevertheless, works on enhancing CMs for
e-commerce or other decision-making chain domains are scanty. This paper
offers a systematic review of the literature on fashion CMs with
applications to decision-making in FRSCs, mining topics for a research
agenda. Research on the theme is relevant and urgent for the fashion
business, which is still in its infancy. Work on the agenda topics could
benefit distinct fashion stakeholders, not just customers, and produce
well-grounded decision-making in varied FRSC contexts and dynamics."
"Applying Internet information technology combined with deep learning to
tourism collaborative recommendation system";"Recently, more personalized travel methods have emerged in the tourism
industry, such as individual travel and self-guided travel. The service
models of traditional tourism limit the diversity of service options and
cannot fully meet the individual needs of tourists anymore. The aim is
to integrate sparse tourism information on the Internet, thereby
providing more convenient, faster, and more personalized tourism
services. Based on the shortcomings of the traditional tourism
recommendation system, a deep learning-based classification processing
method of tourism product information is proposed. This method uses word
embedding in the data preprocessing stage. The Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) is used to process review information of users and tourism
service items. The Deep Neural Network (DNN) is used to process the
necessary information of users and tourism service items. Also,
factorization machine technology is used to learn the interaction
between the extracted features to improve the prediction model. The
results show that the proposed model can maintain an excellent precision
of 64.2\% when generating personalized recommendation lists for users.
The sensitivity and accuracy of the recommendation list are better than
other algorithms. By adding DNN, the word embedding method, and the
factorization machine model, the precision is improved by 30\%, 33.3\%,
and 40\%, respectively. The model accuracy is the highest with 40 hidden
factors, 100 convolutions, and a 100+50 combination hidden layer.
Compared with traditional methods, the proposed algorithm can provide
users with personalized travel products more accurately in personalized
travel recommendations. The results have enriched and developed the
theory of tourism service supply chain, providing a reference for
constructing a personalized tourism service system."
AwARE: a framework for adaptive recommendation of educational resources;"Recommender systems appeared in the early 90s to help users deal with
cognitive overload brought by the internet. From there to now, such
systems have assumed many other roles like help users to explore,
improve decision making, or even entertain. The system needs to look to
user characteristics to accomplish such new goals. These characteristics
help understand what the user task is and how to adapt the
recommendation to support such task. Related research has proposed
recommender systems in education. These recommender systems help
learners to find the educational resources most fit for their needs. In
this paper, we present an integration model between recommender and
adaptive hypermedia systems. It results in a new process for educational
resource recommendation, using a new algorithm of adaptive
recommendation. Through a prototype and an online experiment on the
educational scenario, we proved that AwARE could improve the
recommendation accuracy, interaction with the system, and user
satisfaction. Besides the prototype description, the paper presents a
protocol to evaluate the proposed approach by both the providers' and
consumers' point of view."
"Reducing retail supply chain costs of product returns using digital
product fitting";"Purpose - This paper investigate how fit uncertainty impacts product
return costs in online retailing and how digital product fitting, a
pre-sales fitting practice, can reduce fit uncertainty.
Design/methodology/approach - The paper analyzes the current performance
of a retailer's e-commerce and return operations by estimating costs
generated by product returns, including product handling costs, tied-up
capital, inventory holding costs, transportation costs, and
order-picking costs. The estimated costs were built on 2,229 return
transactions from a Scandinavian fashion footwear retailer. A digital
product fitting technology was tested with the retailer's products and
resulted in estimations on how such technology could affect product
returns.
Findings - The cost of a return is approximately 17\% of the prime cost.
The major cost elements are product handling costs and transportation
costs, which together amount to 72\% of the total costs. If well
calibrated, the fitting technology can cut fit-related return costs by
up to 80\%. The findings show how customers reacted to the fitting
technology: it was unable to verify fit every time, but it serves as a
useful and effective support tool for customers when placing orders.
Research limitations/implications - Virtual fit verification using
digital product fitting is key to retailers to reduce fit-related
returns. Digital product fitting using three-dimensional scanning is
more appropriate for some products, but it is unsuitable for products
that are difficult to measure and scan.
Originality/value - The paper contributes an empirical estimate of
retail supply chain costs associated with fit uncertainty, as well as
theoretical understanding of the role of pre-sales fit verification in
avoiding product returns."
"From product recommendation to cyber-attack prediction: generating
attack graphs and predicting future attacks";"Modern information society depends on reliable functionality of
information systems infrastructure, while at the same time the number of
cyber-attacks has been increasing over the years and damages have been
caused. Furthermore, graphs can be used to show paths than can be
exploited by attackers to intrude into systems and gain unauthorized
access through vulnerability exploitation. This paper presents a method
that builds attack graphs using data supplied from the maritime supply
chain infrastructure. The method delivers all possible paths that can be
exploited to gain access. Then, a recommendation system is utilized to
make predictions about future attack steps within the network. We show
that recommender systems can be used in cyber defense by predicting
attacks. The goal of this paper is to identify attack paths and show how
a recommendation method can be used to classify future cyber-attacks in
terms of risk management. The proposed method has been experimentally
evaluated and validated, with the results showing that it is both
practical and effective."
"A survey on blockchain-based Recommender Systems: Integration
architecture and taxonomy";"A Recommender System (RS) is an integral part of present-day leading web
services, such as YouTube, Amazon, Netflix, and many others. Modern RSs
are challenged to go beyond their traditional role of predicting user
preferences to efficiently provide reliable, carefully personalized, and
highly accurate recommendations. This paper thoroughly explores and
analyzes state-of-the-art literature surveys on RS to extract important
challenges and open issues. Our goal in this paper is to survey the
literature to extract essential features of RSs and Blockchain (BC),
focusing on their integration. Because of the lack of an existing
foundation of BC-based RSs, the intrinsic BC aspects in RSs are
identified and described. Integrating BC technology within RSs can
achieve many benefits such as transparency, decentralization, and
security. To that end, a thorough study of the papers on current
BC-based RSs is presented along with a synthesized comprehensive
taxonomy. Furthermore, a modular RS architecture, encompassing on-chain
and off-chain storage and computation processes, is designed. This paper
also includes a thorough discussion on the validity of the proposed
architecture, BC limitations concerning RSs, and the derivation of a
rich set of pointers to future research directions."
"Presenting a hybrid model in social networks recommendation system
architecture development";"There are many studies conducted on recommendation systems, most of
which are focused on recommending items to users and vice versa.
Nowadays, social networks are complicated due to carrying vast arrays of
data about individuals and organizations. In today's competitive
environment, companies face two significant problems: supplying
resources and attracting new customers. Even the concept of supply-chain
management in a virtual environment is changed. In this article, we
propose a new and innovative combination approach to recommend
organizational people in social networks based on organizational
communication and SCM. The proposed approach uses a hybrid strategy that
combines basic collaborative filtering and demographic recommendation
systems, using data mining, artificial neural networks, and fuzzy
techniques. The results of experiments and evaluations based on a real
dataset collected from the LinkedIn social network showed that the
hybrid recommendation system has higher accuracy and speed than other
essential methods, even substantially has eliminated the fundamental
problems with such systems, such as cold start, scalability, diversity,
and serendipity."
"Nudging a Slow-Moving High-Margin Product in a Supply Chain with
Constrained Capacity";"For a slow-moving high-margin product, we demonstrate the viability of
an information-based nudging strategy. The motivation to study this
problem was because a firm faced availability constraints for one of its
slow-moving high-margin products, but the available quantities still
exceeded the current demand. To identify customers to nudge, we develop
a support vector machine (SVM) approach to rank order the customers
based on their propensity to purchase the product. The underlying notion
in our approach is that Type I errors, to be defined in the paper, in
our classifier are not necessarily problematic but are potential nudging
targets. Also, as a consequence, traditional ways of evaluating
classifiers (with Type I and Type II errors) are not appropriate.
Therefore, we conduct a field experiment to evaluate how well the
identified customers are nudged through information and/or couponing. We
find that in terms of the successful nudges, our SVM-based approach
performed better than other approaches. The experiment also generated
insights about when couponing as opposed to information is more
effective when nudging."
Web-Based Recommendation System for Smart Tourism: Multiagent Technology;"The purpose of the study is to design and develop a recommended system
based on agent and web technologies, which utilizes a hybrid
recommendation filtering for the smart tourism industry. A hybrid
recommendation system based on agent technology is designed by
considering the online communication with other sectors in the tourism
industry, such as the tourism supply chain, agency etc. However, online
communication between the sectors via agents is designed and developed
based on the contract net protocol. Furthermore, the design system is
developed on the java agent development framework and implemented as a
web application. Case study-based results considering two scenarios
involving 100 customers illustrated that the proposed web application
improves the rate of the recommendation for the customers. In the first
scenario without disturbances, this rate was improved by 20\% and the
second scenario with disturbances yielded a 30\% rate of acceptable
recommendation. In addition, based on the second scenario, real time
data communication on the system occurred, thus the proposed system
supported real time data communication."
"A BERT-based recommender system for secure blockchain-based cyber
physical drug supply chain management";"Drug Supply Chain Management (DSCM) can be one of the most affected
streams in healthcare due to pandemics. The delivery of medicine to
patients through DSCM is a complex process. Also, DSCM has several
challenges, including counterfeiting, fraud, and the availability of
medicine. Therefore, there is a need for security and intelligence
strategies to remove pharmaceutical fraud, which remains a significant
challenge since ensuring fair and secure access to medicine, services,
and assistance is essential in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)-based DSCM.
The existing CPS-based DSCM systems do, however, have some limitations
in security, intelligence, planning, scheduling, quality, and logistics.
This paper proposes a secure drug supply chain management framework that
can acheive more security and intelligence via machine learning models.
The proposed framework utilizes Bidirectional Encoder Representations
from Transformers (BERT)-based and machine learning-based attack
detection modules to provide more intelligence and security in block
chain-based DSCM. Evaluation results show that BERT-based recommender
systems ideally suggest appropriate alternative drugs that are close to
99\% similar to the prescribed medication based on public datasets.
Moreover, attack detection in the proposed framework provides
significant accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure results in threat
detection (phishing, scamming, and abnormal transactions) in the
blockchain layer:"
"Exploring recommendations for circular supply chain management through
interactive visualisation";"The new era of circular supply chain management (CSCM) produces a new
complex decision area for process managers. Part of it can be attributed
to green procurement, in which a large number of potential ideas need to
be reviewed that can sustain business. Such a large amount of data can
quickly lead to information overload, especially without the presence of
appropriate decision support tools. While there exists a range of
visualisation methods that can aid the exploration of recommendations,
there is a lack of studies that illustrate how these exploration
techniques can facilitate the identification of CSCM activities. This
paper showcases a study on how to ease the identification of new
sustainable business opportunities through visual data exploration.
Following the design science methodology, we have designed and evaluated
a recommender system prototype (the IS Identification App) that supports
sector-based identification of industrial symbiosis. The interactive
visualisation enhances users with more control over recommendations and
makes the recommendation process more transparent. Our case study
results indicate that the interactive visualisation technique is a
viable, fast and effective approach for exploring recommendations that
increase the sustainability of the supply chain."
"A Blockchain and Machine Learning-Based Drug Supply Chain Management and
Recommendation System for Smart Pharmaceutical Industry";"From the last decade, pharmaceutical companies are facing difficulties
in tracking their products during the supply chain process, allowing the
counterfeiters to add their fake medicines into the market. Counterfeit
drugs are analyzed as a very big challenge for the pharmaceutical
industry worldwide. As indicated by the statistics, yearly business loss
of around \$200 billion is reported by US pharmaceutical companies due
to these counterfeit drugs. These drugs may not help the patients to
recover the disease but have many other dangerous side effects.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) survey report, in
under-developed countries every 10th drug use by the consumers is
counterfeit and has low quality. Hence, a system that can trace and
track drug delivery at every phase is needed to solve the counterfeiting
problem. The blockchain has the full potential to handle and track the
supply chain process very efficiently. In this paper, we have proposed
and implemented a novel blockchain and machine learning-based drug
supply chain management and recommendation system (DSCMR). Our proposed
system consists of two main modules: blockchain-based drug supply chain
management and machine learning-based drug recommendation system for
consumers. In the first module, the drug supply chain management system
is deployed using Hyperledger fabrics which is capable of continuously
monitor and track the drug delivery process in the smart pharmaceutical
industry. On the other hand, the N-gram, LightGBM models are used in the
machine learning module to recommend the top-rated or best medicines to
the customers of the pharmaceutical industry. These models have trained
on well known publicly available drug reviews dataset provided by the
UCI: an open-source machine learning repository. Moreover, the machine
learning module is integrated with this blockchain system with the help
of the REST API. Finally, we also perform several tests to check the
efficiency and usability of our proposed system."
"Recommender Systems in the Offline Retailing Domain: A Systematic
Literature Review";"Recommender systems have over the years proved to be effective in
overcoming the challenges related to the incredible growth of the
information on the Web, and nowadays they are evidently popular in a
variety of apparently disparate domains, e.g., e-commerce, tourism and
healthcare. Nonetheless, no Systematic Literature Review (SLR), and even
no literature survey, aimed at analyzing the current state of academic
and industrial research knowledge on recommender systems for the offline
retailing domain is reported in the literature. There is, therefore, a
need for conducting a SLR that allows revealing the trends and
challenges in the research and development of recommender systems for
that domain. In this chapter, we present the details about the planning,
execution and analysis of results of a SLR of the state of the art of
recommender systems for the offline retailing domain. The findings of
the analysis of results shed light, among other things, on the necessity
of further research on recommendation systems and algorithms for the
offline retailing domain, specially, for small local stores and chain
stores in the categories of department stores, drugstores and
convenience stores."
"Matching Consignees/Shippers Recommendation System in Courier Service
Using Data Analytics";"The purpose of this research was to create a Matching
Consignees/Shippers Recommendation System (MCSRS). We used the
association rule to identify product associations, the clustering
technique to group shippers and consignees according to behaviors when
receiving goods from similar shipper groups, and the decision tree to
identify possible matches between shippers and consignees. Finally,
Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate potential revenue. The case
study is a courier company in Thailand. The results showed that garment
products and clothes were the products with the highest association.
Shippers and consignees of these products were segmented according to
recency, frequency, monetary factors, number of customers, number of
product items, weight, and day. Three rules are proposed that enabled
the assignment of 8 consignees to 56 shippers with an estimated increase
in revenue by 36\%. This approach helps decision-makers to develop an
effective cost-saving new marketing, inclusive strategy quickly."
"A Hybrid Recommendation System Based on the Supply Chain in Social
Networks";"With the expansion of virtual social networks, finding and recommending
appropriate and favorite information and items to users is one of the
severe issues in their development. To this end, recommender systems
predict and recommend interests based on past behavior reviews and user
preferences. However, less research has been done on people to people in
social networks, and it is still based on exploring communication and
friendship circles, which is generally not desirable for specialized
users. Social networks include a variety of entities such as
individuals, businesses, companies, and technical communications that
also contain a variety of information related to the supply chain
interaction, such as industries, functions, and communications between
them and users.
This paper provides a recommendation system framework for recommending
people to people in social networks based on supply chain interactions.
For this purpose, it has presented five hybrid methods based on
artificial neural networks and fuzzy strategies to provide better and
more accurate recommendations than basic methods. Eventually, a case
study was conducted on the LinkedIn social network to show the
improvements in applying this new approach to primary methods. In this
regard, seven specific evaluation criteria of recommender systems have
been used."
LORI: A Learning-to-Rank-Based Integration Method of Location Recommendation;Location recommendation method is an important application in a location-based social network. At present, it is a trend to integrate different recommendation methods since they have their own advantages in capturing different preferences of users and an integrated method can generally provide a better performance than every individual. However, the existing integration policies do not learn user preferences in their integration processes so that they cannot make full use of the advantage of each method. Therefore, we propose a novel integration method: learning-to-rank-based integration. In our method, a confidence coefficient is applied for each user in the integration process, and these coefficients can well optimize recommendation performance. A learning-to-rank-based algorithm is designed to train the confidence coefficients. A group of experiments are done on a real large-scale check-in data set, and the results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art ones.
Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning;Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, and we, as machine learning (ML) experts, may wonder how we can help. Here we describe how ML can be a powerful tool in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and helping society adapt to a changing climate. From smart grids to disaster management, we identify high impact problems where existing gaps can be filled by ML, in collaboration with other fields. Our recommendations encompass exciting research questions as well as promising business opportunities. We call on the ML community to join the global effort against climate change.
How to Approach Ambiguous Queries in Conversational Search: A Survey of Techniques, Approaches, Tools, and Challenges;The advent of recent Natural Language Processing technology has led human and machine interactions more toward conversation. In Conversational Search Systems (CSS) like chatbots and Virtual Personal Assistants such as Apple’s Siri, Amazon Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Google Assistant, both user and device have a limited platform to communicate through chatting or voice. In the information-seeking process, often users do not know how to properly describe their information need in a machine understandable language. Consequently, it is hard for the assistant agent to predict the user’s intent and yield relevant results by only relying on the original query. Studies have shown many unsatisfactory results can be enhanced with the benefit of CSS, which can dig deeper into the user’s query to reveal the real need. This survey intends to provide a comprehensive and comparative overview of ambiguous query clarification task in the context of conversational search technology. We investigate different approaches, their evaluation methods, and future work. We also address the importance of understanding a query for retrieving the most relevant document(s) and satisfying user’s need by predicting their potential request. This work provides an overview of characteristics of ambiguous queries and contributes to better understanding of the existing technologies and challenges in CSS focus on disambiguation of unclear queries from various dimensions.
Resource Management in Cloud and Cloud-Influenced Technologies for Internet of Things Applications;The trend of adopting Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare, smart cities, Industry 4.0, and so on is increasing by means of cloud computing, which provides on-demand storage and computation facilities over the Internet. To meet specific requirements of IoT applications, the cloud has also shifted its service offering platform to its next-generation models, such as fog, mist, and dew computing. As a result, the cloud and IoT have become part and parcel of smart applications that play significant roles in improving the quality of human life. In addition to the inherent advantages of advanced cloud models, to improve the performance of IoT applications further, it is essential to understand how the resources in the cloud and cloud-influenced platforms are managed to support various phases in the end-to-end IoT deployment. Considering this importance, in this article, we provide a brief description, a systematic review, and possible research directions on every aspect of resource management tasks, such as workload modeling, resource provisioning, workload scheduling, resource allocation, load balancing, energy management, and resource heterogeneity in such advanced platforms, from a cloud perspective. The primary objective of this article is to help early researchers gain insight into the underlying concepts of resource management tasks in the cloud for IoT applications.
A Comprehensive Survey on Interoperability for IIoT: Taxonomy, Standards, and Future Directions;In the era of Industry 4.0, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) performs the driving position analogous to the initial industrial metamorphosis. IoT affords the potential to couple machine-to-machine intercommunication and real-time information-gathering within the industry domain. Hence, the enactment of IoT in the industry magnifies effective optimization, authority, and data-driven judgment. However, this field undergoes several interoperable issues, including large numbers of heterogeneous IoT gadgets, tools, software, sensing, and processing components, joining through the Internet, despite the deficiency of communication protocols and standards. Recently, various interoperable protocols, platforms, standards, and technologies are enhanced and altered according to the specifications of the applicability in industrial applications. However, there are no recent survey papers that primarily examine various interoperability issues that Industrial IoT (IIoT) faces. In this review, we investigate the conventional and recent developments of relevant state-of-the-art IIoT technologies, frameworks, and solutions for facilitating interoperability between different IIoT components. We also discuss several interoperable IIoT standards, protocols, and models for digitizing the industrial revolution. Finally, we conclude this survey with an inherent discussion of open challenges and directions for future research.
Blockchain-Empowered Federated Learning: Challenges, Solutions, and Future Directions;Federated learning is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique that trains models across multiple devices holding local data samples without exchanging them. There are many challenging issues in federated learning, such as coordinating participants’ activities, arbitrating their benefits, and aggregating models. Most existing solutions employ a centralized approach, in which a trustworthy central authority is needed for coordination. Such an approach incurs many disadvantages, including vulnerability to attacks, lack of credibility, and difficulty in calculating rewards. Recently, blockchain was identified as a potential solution for addressing the abovementioned issues. Extensive research has been conducted, and many approaches, methods, and techniques have been proposed. There is a need for a systematic survey to examine how blockchain can empower federated learning. Although there are many surveys on federated learning, few of them cover blockchain as an enabling technology. This work comprehensively surveys challenges, solutions, and future directions for blockchain-empowered federated learning (BlockFed). First, we identify the critical issues in federated learning and explain why blockchain provides a potential approach to addressing these issues. Second, we categorize existing system models into three classes: decoupled, coupled, and overlapped, according to how the federated learning and blockchain functions are integrated. Then we compare the advantages and disadvantages of these three system models, regard the disadvantages as challenging issues in BlockFed, and investigate corresponding solutions. Finally, we identify and discuss the future directions, including open problems in BlockFed.
Botnet Business Models, Takedown Attempts, and the Darkweb Market: A Survey;Botnets account for a substantial portion of cybercrime. Botmasters utilize darkweb marketplaces to promote and provide their services, which can vary from renting or buying a botnet (or parts of it) to hiring services (e.g., distributed denial of service attacks). At the same time, botnet takedown attempts have proven to be challenging, demanding a combination of technical and legal methods, and often requiring the collaboration of a plethora of entities with varying jurisdictions. In this article, we map the elements associated with the business aspect of botnets and utilize them to develop adaptations of two widely used business models. Furthermore, we analyze the 28 most notable botnet takedown operations carried out from 2008 to 2021, in regard to the methods employed, and illustrate the correlation between these methods and the segments of our adapted business models. Our analysis suggests that the botnet takedown methods have been mainly focused on the technical side, but not on the botnet economic components. We aim to shed light on new takedown vectors and incentivize takedown actors to expand their efforts to methods oriented more toward the business side of botnets, which could contribute toward eliminating some of the challenges that surround takedown operations.
Threats to Training: A Survey of Poisoning Attacks and Defenses on Machine Learning Systems;Machine learning (ML) has been universally adopted for automated decisions in a variety of fields, including recognition and classification applications, recommendation systems, natural language processing, and so on. However, in light of high expenses on training data and computing resources, recent years have witnessed a rapid increase in outsourced ML training, either partially or completely, which provides vulnerabilities for adversaries to exploit. A prime threat in training phase is called poisoning attack, where adversaries strive to subvert the behavior of machine learning systems by poisoning training data or other means of interference. Although a growing number of relevant studies have been proposed, the research among poisoning attack is still overly scattered, with each paper focusing on a particular task in a specific domain. In this survey, we summarize and categorize existing attack methods and corresponding defenses, as well as demonstrate compelling application scenarios, thus providing a unified framework to analyze poisoning attacks. Besides, we also discuss the main limitations of current works, along with the corresponding future directions to facilitate further researches. Our ultimate motivation is to provide a comprehensive and self-contained survey of this growing field of research and lay the foundation for a more standardized approach to reproducible studies.
Continuous Integration and Delivery Practices for Cyber-Physical Systems: An Interview-Based Study;Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) practices have shown several benefits for software development and operations, such as faster release cycles and early discovery of defects. For Cyber-Physical System (CPS) development, CI/CD can help achieving required goals, such as high dependability, yet it may be challenging to apply. This article empirically investigates challenges, barriers, and their mitigation occurring when applying CI/CD practices to develop CPSs in 10 organizations working in eight different domains. The study has been conducted through semi-structured interviews, by applying an open card sorting procedure together with a member-checking survey within the same organizations, and by validating the results through a further survey involving 55 professional developers. The study reveals several peculiarities in the application of CI/CD to CPSs. These include the need for (i) combining continuous and periodic builds while balancing the use of Hardware-in-the-Loop and simulators, (ii) coping with difficulties in software deployment (iii) accounting for simulators and Hardware-in-the-Loop differing in their behavior, and (vi) combining hardware/software expertise in the development team. Our findings open the road toward recommenders aimed at supporting the setting and evolution of CI/CD pipelines, as well as university curricula requiring interdisciplinarity, such as knowledge about hardware, software, and their interplay.
Are We Forgetting about Compositional Optimisers in Bayesian Optimisation?;Bayesian optimisation presents a sample-efficient methodology for global optimisation. Within this framework, a crucial performance-determining subroutine is the maximisation of the acquisition function, a task complicated by the fact that acquisition functions tend to be non-convex and thus nontrivial to optimise. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive empirical study of approaches to maximise the acquisition function. Additionally, by deriving novel, yet mathematically equivalent, compositional forms for popular acquisition functions, we recast the maximisation task as a compositional optimisation problem, allowing us to benefit from the extensive literature in this field. We highlight the empirical advantages of the compositional approach to acquisition function maximisation across 3958 individual experiments comprising synthetic optimisation tasks as well as tasks from Bayesmark. Given the generality of the acquisition function maximisation subroutine, we posit that the adoption of compositional optimisers has the potential to yield performance improvements across all domains in which Bayesian optimisation is currently being applied.
"Advertising or recommender systems? A game-theoretic analysis of online
retailer platforms' decision-making";"Advertising and recommender systems are two germane demand creation
tools to expand the market. We examine the model comprising two
manufacturers and one online retailer to study the efficacy of
advertising investment based on recommender systems with and without
considering cost sharing. Based on game-theoretic models and numerical
analysis in three scenarios, some managerial insights are suggested for
online retailers to be the best beneficiary and avoid ``free riders.{''}
For the whole supply chain, advertising has a better effect than
recommender systems when their coefficients are small. Otherwise,
leveraging recommender systems is a predominant strategy for the whole
supply chain."
GeoAI – Accelerating a Virtuous Cycle between AI and Geo;"Geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) is the amalgamation of
artificial intelligence (AI) with spatial computing to develop a bet-
ter understanding of the physical world around us at the levels
of an individual, communities, cities, nations, and the planet us-
ing geospatial data. The current applications of GeoAI vary from
solving challenges in the fields of sustainable development, urban
planning, supply chains, and navigation to defense, epidemiology,
insurance, and the emerging on-demand economy. It is a highly
interdisciplinary field that uses ideas from computing, geography,
spatial data science, statistics, and engineering. The unique features
of geospatial data like autocorrelation, geometric nature, and mul-
tiple modalities requires the AI algorithms to be developed in a
fundamentally different way, which also expands the capabilities
of AI in general. Considering the exponential increasing geospa-
tial data and application, this confluence of AI and geospatial will
become a virtuous cycle of growth for both AI and Geo."
Who's in Charge Here? Scheduling EV Charging on Dynamic Grids via Online Auctions with Soft Deadlines;"The electrification of transport is a crucial step towards decarbonizing energy use and meeting climate goals. However, the increased penetration of electric vehicles also drives substantial additional load on the electricity grid; failure to manage this load can result in higher costs and reduced reliability of electricity. In this study, we present a novel online, auction-based technique to manage the charging of electric vehicles. Our technique draws insight from the cloud computing literature, making use of the concept of soft deadlines to ensure high satisfaction among users, reduced costs for charging infrastructure providers, and maximum flexibility for the electricity system. We evaluate our technique with a range of dynamics possible on typical electricity grids, including variable electricity tariffs and deployment of solar photovoltaic generation. Additionally, we consider vehicle-to-vehicle charging, an emerging paradigm for peer-to-peer energy transfer. Compared to uncontrolled charging and two typically deployed algorithms, our results show improved cost and performance in every scenario, with a reduction in costs of 3.5% to 12% compared to the baseline controlled approaches."
Designing and Evaluating Interfaces That Highlight News Coverage Diversity Using Discord Questions;Modern news aggregators do the hard work of organizing a large news stream, creating collections for a given news story with tens of source options. This paper shows that navigating large source collections for a news story can be challenging without further guidance. In this work, we design three interfaces – the Annotated Article, the Recomposed Article, and the Question Grid – aimed at accompanying news readers in discovering coverage diversity while they read. A first usability study with 10 journalism experts confirms the designed interfaces all reveal coverage diversity and determine each interface’s potential use cases and audiences. In a second usability study, we developed and implemented a reading exercise with 95 novice news readers to measure exposure to coverage diversity. Results show that Annotated Article users are able to answer questions 34% more completely than with two existing interfaces while finding the interface equally easy to use.
Building Blocks for IoT Testing: A Benchmark of IoT Apps and a Functional Testing Framework;IoT security is a topic that offers numerous opportunities for improvement and development. In this paper, we first present a set of open-source mock IoT applications along with the necessary infrastructure specifically designed to emulate a real IoT system. With our app set, users can add their own applications, automation rules, and communication flows with little technical effort, and test different scenarios to reproduce bugs that are not specific to the use of a single device. Second, we describe a functional testing framework for the IoT that is inspired by behavior-driven development (BDD), a testing methodology that serves as a proof-of-concept for how the application set can be used in different test scenarios. The application set and the functional testing framework are independent of each other. Our goal is to help IoT developers and testers find new testing techniques and benchmarking them in a reproducible, comparable, and less biased environment. We believe that they form the basis for a better understanding of how to test systems composed of heterogeneous devices to find issues and vulnerabilities that arise mainly from their interaction and data persistence management.
On Indirectly Dependent Documentation in the Context of Code Evolution: A Study;A software system evolves over time due to factors such as bug-fixes, enhancements, optimizations and deprecation. As entities interact in a software repository, the alterations made at one point may require the changes to be reflected at various other points to maintain consistency. However, often less attention is given to making appropriate changes to the documentation associated with the functions. Inconsistent documentation is undesirable, since documentation serves as a useful source of information about the functionality. This paper presents a study on the prevalence of function documentations that are indirectly or implicitly dependent on entities other than the associated function. We observe a substantial presence of such documentations, with 62% of the studied Javadoc comments being dependent on other entities, as studied in 11 open-source repositories implemented in Java. We comprehensively analyze the nature of documentation updates made in 1288 commit logs and study patterns to reason about the cause of dependency in the documentation. Our findings from the observed patterns may be applied to suggest documentations that should be updated on making a change in the repository.
"An intelligent method for supply chain finance selection using supplier
segmentation: A payment risk portfolio approach";"The COVID-19 pandemic-driven financial crisis grew significant interest
among firms to adopt supply chain finance (SCF) to optimize working
capital for the financial stability of the supply chain. However, it is
impractical for firms with a diverse and extensive supplier base to
strategize the SCF solutions for individual suppliers by assessing their
financial risk. Hence, this study conceptualizes an intelligent method
to demonstrate how supplier segmentation based on suppliers' payment
risk portfolios helps supply chain practitioners to assess suppliers'
financial risk and strategize manageable supply chain finance solutions
for them. This method employs a stochastic optimization model to compute
suppliers' optimum payment risk portfolios and generate a supplier
segmentation matrix to offer supply chain practitioners the cognitive
ability to select appropriate SCF solutions for their suppliers. The
proposed method can be implemented into an AI-driven explainable
recommendation system to aid supply chain practitioners in applying
smart strategic thinking in supply chain finance decision-making."
The ICARUS Ontology: A General Aviation Ontology Developed Using a Multi-Layer Approach;The management of aviation data is a great challenge in the aviation industry, as they are complex and can be derived from heterogeneous data sources. To handle this challenge, ontologies can be applied to facilitate the modelling of the data across multiple data sources. This paper presents an aviation domain ontology, the ICARUS ontology, which aims at facilitating the semantic description and integration of information resources that represent the various assets of the ICARUS platform and their use. To present the functionality and usability of the proposed ontology, we present the results of querying the ontology using SPARQL queries through three use case scenarios. As shown from the evaluation, the ICARUS ontology enables the integration and reasoning over multiple sources of heterogeneous aviation-related data, the semantic description of metadata produced by ICARUS, and their storage in a knowledge-base which is dynamically updated and provides access to its contents via SPARQL queries.
Causal Perception in Question-Answering Systems;Root cause analysis is a common data analysis task. While question-answering systems enable people to easily articulate a why question (e.g., why students in Massachusetts have high ACT Math scores on average) and obtain an answer, these systems often produce questionable causal claims. To investigate how such claims might mislead users, we conducted two crowdsourced experiments to study the impact of showing different information on user perceptions of a question-answering system. We found that in a system that occasionally provided unreasonable responses, showing a scatterplot increased the plausibility of unreasonable causal claims. Also, simply warning participants that correlation is not causation seemed to lead participants to accept reasonable causal claims more cautiously. We observed a strong tendency among participants to associate correlation with causation. Yet, the warning appeared to reduce the tendency. Grounded in the findings, we propose ways to reduce the illusion of causality when using question-answering systems.
Representation of Developer Expertise in Open Source Software;Background: Accurate representation of developer expertise has always been an important research problem. While a number of studies proposed novel methods of representing expertise within individual projects, these methods are difficult to apply at an ecosystem level. However, with the focus of software development shifting from monolithic to modular, a method of representing developers' expertise in the context of the entire OSS development becomes necessary when, for example, a project tries to find new maintainers and look for developers with relevant skills. Aim: We aim to address this knowledge gap by proposing and constructing the Skill Space where each API, developer, and project is represented and postulate how the topology of this space should reflect what developers know (and projects need). Method: we use the World of Code infrastructure to extract the complete set of APIs in the files changed by open source developers and, based on that data, employ Doc2Vec embeddings for vector representations of APIs, developers, and projects. We then evaluate if these embeddings reflect the postulated topology of the Skill Space by predicting what new APIs/projects developers use/join, and whether or not their pull requests get accepted. We also check how the developers' representations in the Skill Space align with their self-reported API expertise. Result: Our results suggest that the proposed embeddings in the Skill Space appear to satisfy the postulated topology and we hope that such representations may aid in the construction of signals that increase trust (and efficiency) of open source ecosystems at large and may aid investigations of other phenomena related to developer proficiency and learning.
Marked for Disruption: Tracing the Evolution of Malware Delivery Operations Targeted for Takedown;The malware and botnet phenomenon is among the most significant threats to cybersecurity today. Consequently, law enforcement agencies, security companies, and researchers are constantly seeking to disrupt these malicious operations through so-called takedown counter-operations. Unfortunately, the success of these takedowns is mixed. Furthermore, very little is understood as to how botnets and malware delivery operations respond to takedown attempts. We present a comprehensive study of three malware delivery operations that were targeted for takedown in 2015–16 using global download metadata provided by Symantec. In summary, we found that: (1) Distributed delivery architectures were commonly used, indicating the need for better security hygiene and coordination by the (ab)used service providers. (2) A minority of malware binaries were responsible for the majority of download activity, suggesting that detecting these “super binaries” would yield the most benefit to the security community. (3) The malware operations exhibited displacing and defiant behaviours following their respective takedown attempts. We argue that these “predictable” behaviours could be factored into future takedown strategies. (4) The malware operations also exhibited previously undocumented behaviours, such as Dridex dropping competing brands of malware, or Dorkbot and Upatre heavily relying on upstream dropper malware. These “unpredictable” behaviours indicate the need for researchers to use better threat-monitoring techniques.
Dimensions of Influence in Trucking: Beyond Work Community;Trucking industry and truck drivers’ work are undergoing a change as automation is increasingly used to improve the efficiency of transport operations. Despite predictions of trucking work to disappear due to automation studies show human intervention is still needed in trucking. Generally, studies on future of work and changes digitalization brings to work practice focus is often in in-organization issues, leaving the larger context and external actors unstudied. We take the higher-level viewpoint, asking what kind of actors and factors have an effect in the change in the trucking work practice, and what kind of involvement the actors have in the change. We analyzed 40 interviews, utilizing User Involvement Centered Design model as our lens, and created an illustrative case for the trucking industry to make visible how a collection of decisions, designs, and digital solutions affect the work practice of truck drivers.
Relation-Aware Meta-Learning for E-Commerce Market Segment Demand Prediction with Limited Records;E-commerce business is revolutionizing our shopping experiences by providing convenient and straightforward services. One of the most fundamental problems is how to balance the demand and supply in market segments to build an efficient platform. While conventional machine learning models have achieved great success on data-sufficient segments, it may fail in a large-portion of segments in E-commerce platforms, where there are not sufficient records to learn well-trained models. In this paper, we tackle this problem in the context of market segment demand prediction. The goal is to facilitate the learning process in the target segments by leveraging the learned knowledge from data-sufficient source segments. Specifically, we propose a novel algorithm, RMLDP, to incorporate a multi-pattern fusion network (MPFN) with a meta-learning paradigm. The multi-pattern fusion network considers both local and seasonal temporal patterns for segment demand prediction. In the meta-learning paradigm, transferable knowledge is regarded as the model parameter initialization of MPFN, which are learned from diverse source segments. Furthermore, we capture the segment relations by combining data-driven segment representation and segment knowledge graph representation and tailor the segment-specific relations to customize transferable model parameter initialization. Thus, even with limited data, the target segment can quickly find the most relevant transferred knowledge and adapt to the optimal parameters. We conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale industrial datasets. The results justify that our RMLDP outperforms a set of state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, RMLDP has been deployed in Taobao, a real-world E-commerce platform. The online A/B testing results further demonstrate the practicality of RMLDP.
Achieving Efficiency via Fairness in Online Resource Allocation;The classic utility maximization framework studies the fairness-efficiency tradeoff in various resource allocation problems (e.g., bandwidth allocation). The weighted alpha-fair utility is a common utilitarian metric. However, this classic framework cannot tackle those allocation problems with the online decision-making requirement (e.g., caching capacity allocation under unknown requests). Existing studies on these online allocation problems largely follow the online learning approaches, thus inevitably overlook the allocation fairness. In this paper, we propose a novel utility maximization framework accommodating the online setting. The major challenge of designing this framework lies in the tight coupling between the desirable fairness guarantee and the unknown allocation efficiency. To tackle this, we integrate the weighted alpha-fair utility with the learning rationale, by properly devising the merit-based weights and the increasing fairness levels. Under our proposed framework, the utility-maximizing allocation in each time slot is weighted alpha-fair. Our framework also performs asymptotically as well as the offline optimal/efficient outcome. We demonstrate how this framework functions in two networking applications. In size-based scheduling, it enables network switches to prioritize short flows and avoid flow starvation without the prior flow size information. In file caching, our framework outperforms several state-of-the-art caching policies up to 21% in terms of cache-hit-ratio.
Understanding Political Polarization via Jointly Modeling Users, Connections and Multimodal Contents on Heterogeneous Graphs;Understanding political polarization on social platforms is important as public opinions may become increasingly extreme when they are circulated in homogeneous communities, thus potentially causing damage in the real world. Automatically detecting the political ideology of social media users can help better understand political polarization. However, it is challenging due to the scarcity of ideology labels, complexity of multimodal contents, and cost of time-consuming data collection process. Most previous frameworks either focus on unimodal content or do not scale up well. In this study, we adopt a heterogeneous graph neural network to jointly model user characteristics, multimodal post contents as well as user-item relations in a bipartite graph to learn a comprehensive and effective user embedding without requiring ideology labels. We apply our framework to online discussions about economy and public health topics. The learned embeddings are then used to detect political ideology and understand political polarization. Our framework outperforms the unimodal, early/late fusion baselines, and homogeneous GNN frameworks by a margin of at least 9% absolute gain in the area under the receiver operating characteristic on two social media datasets. More importantly, our work does not require a time-consuming data collection process, which allows faster detection and in turn allows the policy makers to conduct analysis and design policies in time to respond to crises. We also show that our framework learns meaningful user embeddings and can help better understand political polarization. Notable differences in user descriptions, topics, images, and levels of retweet/quote activities are observed. Our framework for decoding user-content interaction shows wide applicability in understanding political polarization. Furthermore, it can be extended to user-item bipartite information networks for other applications such as content and product recommendation.
“Rather Solve the Problem from Scratch”: Gamesploring Human-Machine Collaboration for Optimizing the Debris Collection Problem;Optimizing operations on critical infrastructure networks is key to reducing the impact of disruptive events. In this paper, we explore the potential of having humans and algorithms work together to address this difficult task. For this purpose, we use a gamified experiment to build and assess this potential in the context of the debris collection problem (i.e., “gamesploring”). We developed a digital game where players can request the help of the computer while facing a multi-objective problem of assigning contractors to road segments for clearing debris in a disaster area. Through a within-subjects experimental study, we assessed how players optimized under various circumstances (e.g., initial solution vs. from scratch) compared to the computer on its own. The results are both surprising as well as insightful: they suggest that human-machine collaboration is indeed beneficial but also that more work is needed on how to appropriately guide this form of collaboration.
An Effective Personalised Ranking Model via User Information under the GAN Framework;Recently, as the most popular deep network model, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) has achieved excellent performance in many fields. We have recognized that some pioneer researchers use GAN for personalized recommendation, such as IRGAN and CFGAN. However, we find two limitations about them: these models do not used auxiliary information to alleviate data sparsity problem and do not employed powerful components as basic model. This paper proposes an effective GAN-based personalised ranking model, named as PRGAN that leverages both user behavior information (such as user-item interaction or other implicit feedback) and user demographic information to enhance the recommendation accuracy. Because of data sparsity, we employ extended version of factorization machine i.e. deepFM as the generator. DeepFM not only can be effectively trained in the case of sparse data, but also can learn high-dimensional features. Compared with traditional FM, deepFM utilize user information more effectively to generate accurate user expressions. Furthermore, we employ Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) as our discriminator. After a minimax iteration game, PRGAN finally generates a high-quality ranking list of items according to user performance. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art ranking methods and GAN-based model.
A Flexible Security Analytics Service for the Industrial IoT;In Cloud Computing, the cloud serves as a central data hub for the Industrial Internet of Things' (IIoT) data and is deployed in diverse application fields, e.g., Smart Grid or Smart Manufacturing. Therefore, the aggregated and contextualized data is bundled in a central data hub, bringing tremendous cybersecurity advantages. Given the threat landscape in IIoT systems, especially SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) need to be prepared regarding their cybersecurity, react quickly, and strengthen their overall cybersecurity. For instance, with the application of machine learning algorithms, security-related data can be analyzed predictively in order to be able to ward off a potential attack at an early stage. Since modern reference architectures for IIoT systems, such as RAMI 4.0 or IIRA, consider cybersecurity approaches on a high level and SMEs lack financial funds and knowledge, this paper conceptualizes a security analytics service used as a security add-on to these reference architectures. Thus, this paper conceptualizes a flexible security analytics service that implements security capabilities with flexible analytical techniques that fit specific SMEs' needs. The security analytics service is also evaluated with a real-world use case.
Community Trend Prediction on Heterogeneous Graph in E-Commerce;In online shopping, ever-changing fashion trends make merchants need to prepare more differentiated products to meet the diversified demands, and e-commerce platforms need to capture the market trend with a prophetic vision. For the trend prediction, the attribute tags, as the essential description of items, can genuinely reflect the decision basis of consumers. However, few existing works explore the attribute trend in the specific community for e-commerce. In this paper, we focus on the community trend prediction on the item attribute and propose a unified framework that combines the dynamic evolution of two graph patterns to predict the attribute trend in a specific community. Specifically, we first design a community-attribute bipartite graph at each time step to learn the collaboration of different communities. Next, we transform the bipartite graph into a hypergraph to exploit the associations of different attribute tags in one community. Lastly, we introduce a dynamic evolution component based on the recurrent neural networks to capture the fashion trend of attribute tags. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets in a large e-commerce platform show the superiority of the proposed approach over several strong alternatives and demonstrate the ability to discover the community trend in advance.
Harms from Increasingly Agentic Algorithmic Systems;Research in Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics (FATE)1 has established many sources and forms of algorithmic harm, in domains as diverse as health care, finance, policing, and recommendations. Much work remains to be done to mitigate the serious harms of these systems, particularly those disproportionately affecting marginalized communities. Despite these ongoing harms, new systems are being developed and deployed, typically without strong regulatory barriers, threatening the perpetuation of the same harms and the creation of novel ones. In response, the FATE community has emphasized the importance of anticipating harms, rather than just responding to them. Anticipation of harms is especially important given the rapid pace of developments in machine learning (ML). Our work focuses on the anticipation of harms from increasingly agentic systems. Rather than providing a definition of agency as a binary property, we identify 4 key characteristics which, particularly in combination, tend to increase the agency of a given algorithmic system: underspecification, directness of impact, goal-directedness, and long-term planning. We also discuss important harms which arise from increasing agency – notably, these include systemic and/or long-range impacts, often on marginalized or unconsidered stakeholders. We emphasize that recognizing agency of algorithmic systems does not absolve or shift the human responsibility for algorithmic harms. Rather, we use the term agency to highlight the increasingly evident fact that ML systems are not fully under human control. Our work explores increasingly agentic algorithmic systems in three parts. First, we explain the notion of an increase in agency for algorithmic systems in the context of diverse perspectives on agency across disciplines. Second, we argue for the need to anticipate harms from increasingly agentic systems. Third, we discuss important harms from increasingly agentic systems and ways forward for addressing them. We conclude by reflecting on implications of our work for anticipating algorithmic harms from emerging systems.
Research on the Influencing Factors of Consumer Experience Under the New Retail Mode of Fresh Food;"With the rapid development of the Internet, the deep application of big data, and the combination of social media, consumers' consumption concepts and behaviors are constantly changing, and the business strategies and business models of retailer of fresh food are constantly innovating. In 2016, the concept of ""new retail"" was introduced, which takes ""consumer experience"" as the core. This model not only caters to contemporary consumer experiential demands, but also points out the direction for retailers of fresh food to build competitive advantages. Seven factors that may influence consumer experience were examined in this study: product attribute, timely delivery, channel attribute, information fusion, social interaction, personalized recommendation, consumption scene. The empirical results show that: under the new retail mode of fresh food, product attribute, timely delivery, channel attributes, social interaction, personalized recommendation and consumption scene have significantly positive impact on sensory experience of consumer; product attribute, timely delivery, channel attribute, information fusion, social interaction and consumption scene have significantly positive impact on emotional experience of consumer; product attribute, timely delivery, channel attribute, information fusion, social interaction, personalized recommendation and consumption scene have significantly positive effects on trust experience of consumer."
Three Carriages Driving the Development of Intelligent Digital Twins: Simulation plus Optimization and Learning;Three key technologies are driving the development of intelligent decisions in the era of Industry 4.0. These technologies are machine learning, optimization, and simulation. It shows that solely relying on one technology is not able to meet the decision timeliness and accuracy requirement when solving current industry decision problems. Thus, to meet this challenge, this paper firstly discusses several possible integrations among the three technologies, in which simulation plays an important role in depicting the system models, generating data for optimization and learning, and validating optimized decisions and learned rules. A number of future research directions are pointed out based on the gap between the current technology / tools development and the industry needs. Finally, the paper proposes a possible collaboration mode among higher learning institutes, research institutes, equipment and platform developers, as well as end-users for better shaping the whole intelligent decision ecosystem.
Mobile Technology Contributing to Omni-Channel Retail;Technological integration and convergence enables customers to experience conventional, online and mobile shopping. Companies tailor multiple retail channels in respond to their customers' needs. The so-called omni-channel retail strategy suggests an integrated shopping approach, combining the convenience of various digital channels with the customers' personal experience, typical for brick and mortar settings. Due to the co-existence of multiple sales channels complementing each other, retail companies may better engage with their customers. Moreover, the easy and seamless switching between various retail channels allows customers to experience the brand holistically, and thus be more satisfied with the shopping experience and the product per se, and be more brandloyal. This paper aims to investigate and analyse -- based on recent literature -- the advantages and challenges of omni-channel retailing on a broad, systematic basis from a business perspective. As a result, we identify those aspects of omni-channel retailing, where mobile technologies may contribute either to further improvements or to eliminate drawbacks.
Towards Reliable Missing Truth Discovery in Online Social Media Sensing Applications;"Social media sensing has emerged as a new application paradigm to collect observations from online social media users about the physical environment. A fundamental problem in social media sensing applications lies in estimating the evolving truth of the measured variables and the reliability of data sources without knowing either of them a priori. This problem is referred to as dynamic truth discovery. Two major limitations exist in current truth discovery solutions: i) existing solutions cannot effectively address the missing truth problem where the measured variables do not have any reported measurements from the data sources; ii) the latent correlations among the measured variables were not fully captured and utilized in current solutions. In this paper, we proposed a Reliable Missing Truth Finder (RMTF) to address the above limitations in social media sensing applications. In particular, we develop a novel data-driven technique to identify the lagged and latent correlations among measured variables, and incorporate such correlation information into a holistic spatiotemporal inference model to infer the missing truth. We evaluated the RMTF using the real-world Twitter data feeds. The results show that the RMTF scheme significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art truth discovery solutions by correctly inferring the missing truth of the measured variables."
Do People Believe in Artificial Intelligence? A Cross-Topic Multicultural Study;In the era of 4.0 industry, artificial intelligence and machine learning are the undisputed protagonists on a world-wide stage. In the last decade, expert and learning systems have been widely applied to a plethora of tasks that were considered, in the past, as solvable only by a human. And on top of that, machines are becoming more reliable and accurate than human experts.However, despite the artificial intelligence being drenched in our everyday life, people do not completely realize this radical change, and they have a warped perception of it. In this work, we aim at exploring and analyzing the human perception and trust in artificial intelligence. To this end, we collected personal opinions concerning juicy topics in artificial intelligence literature, meaning the interpretability of black-box models, and the reliability of autonomous systems. The analysis has been conducted on different applications, including medical and cybersecurity domains.
Domain-Specific Term Extraction: A Case Study on Greek Maritime Legal Texts;Preservation of cultural heritage has significantly attracted many research efforts. Amongst them, significant interest has been presented to sharing of cultural heritage content, whereas one major aspect of cultural content is the one concerning maritime heritage. In order to efficiently consume such content, high-quality descriptions are required. Towards this goal, we propose an approach for automatic term extraction of documents, where our methodology is based on the use of word embeddings along with a deep neural network architecture. We demonstrate its efficiency by using a large corpus of legal documents related with maritime.
Outsider Oversight: Designing a Third Party Audit Ecosystem for AI Governance;Much attention has focused on algorithmic audits and impact assessments to hold developers and users of algorithmic systems accountable. But existing algorithmic accountability policy approaches have neglected the lessons from non-algorithmic domains: notably, the importance of third parties. Our paper synthesizes lessons from other fields on how to craft effective systems of external oversight for algorithmic deployments. First, we discuss the challenges of third party oversight in the current AI landscape. Second, we survey audit systems across domains - e.g., financial, environmental, and health regulation - and show that the institutional design of such audits are far from monolithic. Finally, we survey the evidence base around these design components and spell out the implications for algorithmic auditing. We conclude that the turn toward audits alone is unlikely to achieve actual algorithmic accountability, and sustained focus on institutional design will be required for meaningful third party involvement.
Philosophically Speaking...;"I like nothing so much as a good philosophical discussion. For one thing, it just feels so delightfully scientific to be bandying about high minded terms like ""epistemology,"" ""ontology,"" ""realism,"" ""relativism,"" and ""paradigm"" with great abandon. For another thing, it is simply essential in my view of the world of science to which I enjoy belonging that one should be fully engaged in the ethical and normative underpinnings of scientific practice. That, to me, operationally characterizes philosophy of science. Our scientific philosophies facilitate the debating, codifying, and explicating of our ""agreed-to rules of the road"" for doing our work. They are our scientific code of conduct, so to speak. In my way of thinking, the rules of the road are important for all good researchers to understand and share if we are to hew faithfully to our paradigms and do good normal science research. The problem for me is that I see the emerging debate over whether our field is a science or not through two distinct lenses, and I'm getting some parallax out of it. I've earned two doctorates at two different stages of my career; one in marketing when I was much younger, and one more recently in information systems. That does not make me any smarter than the average bear, and it could certainly be argued that it's a sure sign of not being smarter, since one could say I had to do it twice to get it right. Yet, it has afforded me a very unique perspective on the emerging ontological debate about our discipline because, quite literally, I Have Been There Before! I've studied the Philosophy of Science two fulsome times in my career, and I've gotten some interesting perspectives each time as each was in the midst of an existential debate over status, and both of these experience bear upon my agenda-setting here, as an editor. While learning my scientific craft as a first-time doctoral student in marketing, I reveled in the debate that much of academic marketing was enmeshed in during the 80s on whether marketing was a science or a technology and if a science, how best to be practiced. We future scientists all read Kuhn (1970) in our philosophy of science seminar, as well as Dubin (1978) and a flock of excellent philosophical essays collected in a tome edited by the redoubtable Jagdish Sheth (Sheth &amp; Garrett, 1986) - a philosophy of science volume that many in marketing and elsewhere still use, aged though it might be. We marketers also saw a collection of philosophical essays by thought leaders of the field under such titles as ""Marketing, Scientific Progress, and the Scientific Method"" (Anderson, 1983), ""On Making Marketing Science more Scientific"" (Arndt, 1985), ""Paradigms Lost"" (Deshpande, 1983), and ""Metatheory and Metamethodology in Marketing"" (Leong, 1985). The debate in marketing continued well past that point and has extended into recent years (e.g., Brown, 1996; Easton, 2002), indicating that the debate we have now in information systems has years yet to go. It is not a simple question we deal with, and the answers take time and fulsome consideration."
World Food Atlas for Food Navigation;Food plays a central role in agriculture, public wellness, public health, culinary art, and culture. Food-related data is available in varying formats and with different access levels ranging from private datasets to publicly downloadable data. Every food-related query, in principle, is a food recommendation problem. We analyze the components of a food recommendation and its requirements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of having access to worldwide food data from divergent aspects for answering food- and health-related queries that would otherwise be expensive and require specialized domain expertise. We present the World Food Atlas (WFA): An open-source platform for different stakeholders in the food ecosystem to share their data on a global data hub with a singular point of access. The world food atlas contains the availability and inter-connectivity of food and its effects in various forms. We gather real-world questions by partnering with nutritionists, dietitians, and doctors. We categorize the practical food queries to construct requirement tables and develop a novel schema to satisfy the requirement table to model the world food atlas. Finally, we demonstrate how food and lifestyle navigation systems can use the world food atlas to enable personalized and context-driven solutions to person-entity-context queries.
MuxLink: Circumventing Learning-Resilient MUX-Locking Using Graph Neural Network-Based Link Prediction;Logic locking has received considerable interest as a prominent technique for protecting the design intellectual property from untrusted entities, especially the foundry. Recently, machine learning (ML)-based attacks have questioned the security guarantees of logic locking, and have demonstrated considerable success in deciphering the secret key without relying on an oracle, hence, proving to be very useful for an adversary in the fab. Such ML-based attacks have triggered the development of learning-resilient locking techniques. The most advanced state-of-the-art deceptive MUX-based locking (D-MUX) and the symmetric MUX-based locking techniques have recently demonstrated resilience against existing ML-based attacks. Both defense techniques obfuscate the design by inserting key-controlled MUX logic, ensuring that all the secret inputs to the MUXes are equiprobable.In this work, we show that these techniques primarily introduce local and limited changes to the circuit without altering the global structure of the design. By leveraging this observation, we propose a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based link prediction attack, MuxLink, that successfully breaks both the D-MUX and symmetric MUX-locking techniques, relying only on the underlying structure of the locked design, i.e., in an oracle-less setting. Our trained GNN model learns the structure of the given circuit and the composition of gates around the non-obfuscated wires, thereby generating meaningful link embeddings that help decipher the secret inputs to the MUXes. The proposed MuxLink achieves key prediction accuracy and precision up to 100% on D-MUX and symmetric MUX-locked ISCAS-85 and ITC-99 benchmarks, fully unlocking the designs. We open-source MuxLink [1].
Questioning the AI: Informing Design Practices for Explainable AI User Experiences;A surge of interest in explainable AI (XAI) has led to a vast collection of algorithmic work on the topic. While many recognize the necessity to incorporate explainability features in AI systems, how to address real-world user needs for understanding AI remains an open question. By interviewing 20 UX and design practitioners working on various AI products, we seek to identify gaps between the current XAI algorithmic work and practices to create explainable AI products. To do so, we develop an algorithm-informed XAI question bank in which user needs for explainability are represented as prototypical questions users might ask about the AI, and use it as a study probe. Our work contributes insights into the design space of XAI, informs efforts to support design practices in this space, and identifies opportunities for future XAI work. We also provide an extended XAI question bank and discuss how it can be used for creating user-centered XAI.

The Neural Metric Factorization for Computational Drug Repositioning;Computational drug repositioning aims to discover new therapeutic diseases for marketed drugs and has the advantages of low cost, short development cycle, and high controllability compared to traditional drug development. The matrix factorization model has become the cornerstone technique for computational drug repositioning due to its ease of implementation and excellent scalability. However, the matrix factorization model uses the inner product operation to represent the association between drugs and diseases, which is lacking in expressive ability. Moreover, the degree of similarity of drugs or diseases could not be implied on their respective latent factor vectors, which is not satisfy the common sense of drug discovery. Therefore, a neural metric factorization model for computational drug repositioning (NMFDR) is proposed in this work. We novelly consider the latent factor vector of drugs and diseases as a point in the high-dimensional coordinate system and propose a generalized euclidean distance to represent the association between drugs and diseases to compensate for the shortcomings of the inner product operation. Furthermore, by embedding multiple drug (disease) metrics information into the encoding space of the latent factor vector, the information about the similarity between drugs (diseases) can be reflected in the distance between latent factor vectors. Finally, we conduct wide analysis experiments on three real datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the above improvement points and the superiority of the NMFDR model.
Towards Revenue Maximization with Popular and Profitable Products;Economic-wise, a common goal for companies conducting marketing is to maximize the return revenue/profit by utilizing the various effective marketing strategies. Consumer behavior is crucially important in economy and targeted marketing, in which behavioral economics can provide valuable insights to identify the biases and profit from customers. Finding credible and reliable information on products’ profitability is, however, quite difficult since most products tend to peak at certain times w.r.t. seasonal sales cycles in a year. On-Shelf Availability (OSA) plays a key factor for performance evaluation. Besides, staying ahead of hot product trends means we can increase marketing efforts without selling out the inventory. To fulfill this gap, in this paper, we first propose a general profit-oriented framework to address the problem of revenue maximization based on economic behavior, and compute the On-shelf Popular and most Profitable Products (OPPPs) for the targeted marketing. To tackle the revenue maximization problem, we model the k-satisfiable product concept and propose an algorithmic framework for searching OPPP and its variants. Extensive experiments are conducted on several real-world datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
How To Optimize My Blockchain? A Multi-Level Recommendation Approach;Aside from the conception of new blockchain architectures, existing blockchain optimizations in the literature primarily focus on system or data-oriented optimizations within prevailing blockchains. However, since blockchains handle multiple aspects ranging from organizational governance to smart contract design, a holistic approach that encompasses all the different layers of a given blockchain system is required to ensure that all optimization opportunities are taken into consideration. In this vein, we define a multi-level optimization recommendation approach that identifies optimization opportunities within a blockchain at the system, data, and user level. Multiple metrics and attributes are derived from a blockchain log and nine optimization recommendations are formalized. We implement an automated optimization recommendation tool, BlockOptR, based on these concepts. The system is extensively evaluated with a wide range of workloads covering multiple real-world scenarios. After implementing the recommended optimizations, we observe an average of 20% improvement in the success rate of transactions and an average of 40% improvement in latency.
Toward Understanding the COVID-19 Impact on Data Science Innovation in Canada;"Data science provides methods to understand and solve problems in an evidence-based manner by combining data and experience with scientific methods. When included with advances in robotic technologies, telecommunication technologies and internet coverage (digitally enabling infrastructure), and computer hardware, data science creates a host of ""digital technologies"" expected to bring value to business, government, and individuals. Recent adoption and development of these innovations have been affected by the pandemic, even as COVID-19 sped up the move to online activities from shopping to working at home. In this paper, we analyze trends and changes to understand the levels of disruption from COVID-19 on the data science innovation ecosystem. We consider three phases of innovation: early-stage research and development; late-stage research and development; and commercialization and diffusion. We show that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on innovation in data science across the phases of innovation to varying degrees; however, our analysis suggests a return to previous growth may be expected in the short term should the economy continue to improve. These findings suggest that researchers and practitioners should be prepared to take advantage of this return in growth to invest in early stage R&amp;D, to build research programs in data science, and to find ways to commercialize and adopt data science innovations. Our research also identifies the need for co-ordinated efforts to make current and up-to-date data for tracking innovation impacts available."
A Chaincode-Based Framework for Securing Patient Health Information in Hospital Environment;Goal of any healthcare system is to provide good service to the public in a most effective manner. The hospital healthcare system is a common platform for people to access the health related services, anytime and anywhere. This service is completely driven by the regulations and policies of government and hospital administration. At present most hospital systems in India lack a secure mechanism for maintaining and managing patient health records. This is a crucial capability which a hospital healthcare system must have. Failure to have a robust system will cause multiple issues like inaccessibility when required, wrongfully sharing patient health record or allowing unethical players to access the health records. This will ultimately lead to lack of trust in the system Most of the current hospital healthcare systems store information centrally and provide access to the connected nodes as required. This architecture leads to single point of failure when central server is down or crashes or gets hacked. To overcome this problem, we have proposed a Chaincode-based framework to secure patient health information in hospital environment. Chaincode is a smart contract program which gets executed on Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain network automatically. A Chaincode stores the information in decentralized digital ledger and creates a secured and private blockchain network with trusted nodes and provide data visibility, data security, and data transparency with respect to patient health record at any time. This technology could solve the above said problem in more efficient way and provide better visibility and transparency to patient health data with more security.
Introduction to A Compromise Programming Based Method for Complex Scheduling and Planning Problems;Planning and Planning (SP) plays a vital role in many fields. However, SP problems become more complex when they require to archive multi goals in decision-making processes that are more difficult to solve and push the decision-maker into a dilemma. This paper introduces an adaptive method based on the compromise programming approach to multi-objective optimization (MOP) in scheduling and planning (SP) problems. The proposed method gives an effective integration of mathematical programming with evolutionary algorithms (EA). Through the technique, decision-makers can validate the models as well as evaluate different decision alternatives. The method is in the development progress. However, we have obtained preliminary results by applying the method for solving some SP problems. These results show the feasibility of the proposed method.
Production2Vec: A Hybrid Recommender System Combining Semantic and Product Complexity Approach to Improve Industrial Resiliency;COVID-19 health crisis highlights the fragility of European industrial strategies and leads us to develop more agile, distributed, and resilient production models at a territorial level. There are two major challenges in this regard: one is to find solutions to secure supplies and/or industrial value chains, and the other is to identify companies that have the potential to transform their production quickly to cope with an emergency situation. We extended the Word2Vec vector space with products and economic activities allowing us to calculate proximities. We present a methodology based on semantic proximity and productive complexities to assess the ability of an A-company to produce a product B and to anticipate customer/supplier-type collaboration according to industrial quality standards. We consider recommendation topics by intertwining machine learning techniques with semantic approaches, referring to area ontologies incorporating territorial dimensionality.
Coupled Variational Recurrent Collaborative Filtering;We focus on the problem of streaming recommender system and explore novel collaborative filtering algorithms to handle the data dynamicity and complexity in a streaming manner. Although deep neural networks have demonstrated the effectiveness of recommendation tasks, it is lack of explorations on integrating probabilistic models and deep architectures under streaming recommendation settings. Conjoining the complementary advantages of probabilistic models and deep neural networks could enhance both model effectiveness and the understanding of inference uncertainties. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose a Coupled Variational Recurrent Collaborative Filtering (CVRCF) framework based on the idea of Deep Bayesian Learning to handle the streaming recommendation problem. The framework jointly combines stochastic processes and deep factorization models under a Bayesian paradigm to model the generation and evolution of users' preferences and items' popularities. To ensure efficient optimization and streaming update, we further propose a sequential variational inference algorithm based on a cross variational recurrent neural network structure. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both temporal dependency modeling and predictive accuracy. The learned latent variables also provide visualized interpretations for the evolution of temporal dynamics.
Multivariate Realized Volatility Forecasting with Graph Neural Network;"Financial economics and econometrics literature demonstrate that the limit order book data is useful in predicting short-term volatility in stock markets. In this paper, we are interested in forecasting short-term realized volatility in a multivariate approach based on limit order book data and relational stock market networks. To achieve this goal, we introduce Graph Transformer Network for Volatility Forecasting. The model allows combining limit order book features and a large number of temporal and cross-sectional relations from different sources. Through experiments based on about 500 stocks from S&amp;P 500 index, we find a better performance for our model than for other benchmarks."
A Decision Support System with Intelligent Recommendation for Multi-Disciplinary Medical Treatment;Recent years have witnessed an emerging trend for improving disease treatment by forming multi-disciplinary medical teams. The collaboration among specialists from multiple medical domains has been shown to be significantly helpful for designing comprehensive and reliable regimens, especially for incurable diseases. Although this kind of multi-disciplinary treatment has been increasingly adopted by healthcare providers, a new challenge has been introduced to the decision-making process—how to efficiently and effectively develop final regimens by searching for candidate treatments and considering inputs from every expert. In this article, we present a sophisticated decision support system called MdtDSS (a decision support system (DSS) for multi-disciplinary treatment (Mdt)), which is particularly developed to guide the collaborative decision-making in multi-disciplinary treatment scenarios. The system integrates a recommender system that aims to search for personalized candidates from a large-scale high-quality regimen pool and a voting system that helps collect feedback from multiple specialists without potential bias. Our decision support system optimally combines machine intelligence and human experience and helps medical practitioners make informed and accountable regimen decisions. We deployed the proposed system in a large hospital in Shanghai, China, and collected real-world data on large-scale patient cases. The evaluation shows that the proposed system achieves outstanding results in terms of high-quality multi-disciplinary treatment.
Dual Attention Transfer in Session-Based Recommendation with Multi-Dimensional Integration;Session-based recommendation (SBR) is widely used in e-commerce to predict the anonymous user's next click action according to a short sequence. Many previous studies have shown the potential advantages of applying Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to SBR tasks. However, the existing SBR models using GNN to solve user preference problems are only based on one single dataset to obtain one recommendation model during training. While the single dataset has the problems including the excessive sparse data source and the long-distance relationship of items. Therefore, introducing the dual transfer, which can enrich the data source, to SBR is absolutely necessary. To this end, a new method is proposed in this paper, which is called dual attention transfer based on multi-dimensional integration (DAT-MDI): (i) DAT uses a potential mapping method based on a slot attention mechanism to extract the user's representation information in different sessions between multiple domains. (ii) MDI combines the graph neural network for the graphs (session graph and global graph) and the gate recurrent unit (GRU) for the sequence to learn the item representation in each session. Then the multi-level session representation are combined by a soft-attention mechanism. We do a variety of experiments on four benchmark datasets which have shown that the superiority of the DAT-MDI model over the state-of-the-art methods.
Personalized Purchase Prediction of Market Baskets with Wasserstein-Based Sequence Matching;Personalization in marketing aims at improving the shopping experience of customers by tailoring services to individuals. In order to achieve this, businesses must be able to make personalized predictions regarding the next purchase. That is, one must forecast the exact list of items that will comprise the next purchase, ie, the so-called market basket. Despite its relevance to firm operations, this problem has received surprisingly little attention in prior research, largely due to its inherent complexity. In fact, state-of-the-art approaches are limited to intuitive decision rules for pattern extraction, so that repeat purchases or co-purchases can be identified. However, the simplicity of the pre-coded rules impedes performance, since decision rules operate in an autoregressive fashion: the rules can only make inferences from past purchases of a single customer without taking into account the knowledge transfer that takes place between customers.In contrast, our research overcomes the limitations of pre-set rules by contributing a novel predictor of market baskets from sequential purchase histories: our predictions are based on similarity matching in order to identify similar purchase habits among the complete shopping histories of all customers. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We propose similarity matching based on subsequential dynamic time warping (SDTW) as a novel predictor of market baskets. Thereby, we can effectively identify cross-customer patterns. (2) We leverage the Wasserstein distance for measuring the similarity among embedded purchase histories. If desired, this can further be interpreted as a proxy to the prediction quality. (3) We develop a fast approximation algorithm for computing a lower bound of the Wasserstein distance in our setting. An extensive series of computational experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. The accuracy of identifying the exact market baskets based on state-of-the-art decision rules from the literature is outperformed by a factor of 4.0. This contributes to a further personalization in the provision of retail services. The actual use cases are widespread and include making customers tailored offerings in marketing, extending recommender systems for the purpose of suggesting personalized market baskets, and triggering product deliveries before purchase in order to accelerate delivery.
Logistic Regression in Rental Price and Room Type Prediction Based on Airbnb Open Dataset;"Based on Aribnb open dataset, this paper is using Logistic Regression—a machine learning method, to analyse how attributes like location and neighbourhood influence the rental price; and, based on the given attributes associate with the estate, predict both rental price and room type. This work is beneficial to the travelers who have the demand in finding an appropriate estate; it can be also instructive in building the recommendation system which can help travelers to find the best estate they want. Apart from the ordinary method in constructing Logistic Regression model which is binary classification, this paper is using softmax function to implement multi-classification which is room type prediction in this work. Through price prediction did not reach the desirable outcome, the room type prediction, however, reached the accuracy about 80%."
ASPIRE: Air Shipping Recommendation for E-Commerce Products via Causal Inference Framework;Speed of delivery is critical for the success of e-commerce platforms. Faster delivery promise to the customer results in increased conversion and revenue. There are typically two mechanisms to control the delivery speed - a) replication of products across warehouses, and b) air-shipping the product. In this paper, we present a machine learning based framework to recommend air-shipping eligibility for products. Specifically, we develop a causal inference framework (referred to as Air Shipping Recommendation or ASPIRE) that balances the trade-off between revenue or conversion and delivery cost to decide whether a product should be shipped via air. We propose a doubly-robust estimation technique followed by an optimization algorithm to determine air eligibility of products and calculate the uplift in revenue and shipping cost. We ran extensive experiments (both offline and online) to demonstrate the superiority of our technique as compared to the incumbent policies and baseline approaches. ASPIRE resulted in a lift of +79 bps of revenue as measured through an A/B experiment in an emerging marketplace on Amazon.
Towards a Knowledge Graph-Based Approach for Context-Aware Points-of-Interest Recommendations;Context-aware Recommender Systems (CARS) are becoming an integral part of the everyday life by providing users the ability to retrieve relevant information based on their contextual situation. To increase the predictive power considering many parameters, such as mood, hunger level and user preferences, information from heterogeneous sources should be leveraged. However, these data sources are typically isolated and unexplored and the efforts for integrating them are exacerbated by variety of data structures used for their modelling and costly pre-processing operations. We propose a Knowledge Graph-based approach to allow integration of data according to abstract semantic models for Points-of-Interests (POI)s recommendation scenarios. By enriching data with information about attributes, relationships and their meaning, additional knowledge can be derived from what already exists. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach with a concrete example showing benefits of the retrieving the dispersed data with a unified access mechanism.
Decoupled Hyperbolic Graph Attention Network for Modeling Substitutable and Complementary Item Relationships;Modeling substitutable and complementary item relationships is a fundamental and important topic for recommendation in e-commerce online scenarios. In the real world, item relationships are usually coupled, heterogeneous and they also have abundant side information and hierarchical data structures. Recently, to take full advantage of both sides information and topological structure, graph neural networks are widely explored in relationship modeling. However, the existing methods are crude in decoupling heterogeneous relationships. Their model designs lack deep insight of relationships' coupling mode, i.e. neglects the prior knowledge of how relationships affect each other. In addition, many existing graph methods, regardless of how they handle coupled relationships, are deployed in Euclidean spaces, which distorts hierarchical data structure and limits the expressive power due to the non power law characteristic of Euclidean topology. In this paper, we propose a novel Decoupled Hyperbolic Graph Attention Network (DHGAN). The innovations of our DHGAN can be highlighted as two aspects. Firstly, we design metapaths in an adequate way following an algebraic perspective of relationships coupling mode, which helps achieving better model interpretability. Secondly, DHGAN maps heterogeneous relationships into separate hyperbolic spaces, which can better capture the hierarchical information of graph nodes and helps improving model's representational capacity. We conduct extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets, demonstrating DHGAN is superior to the state-of-the-art graph baselines. We release the codes at https://github.com/wt-tju/DHGAN.
A Decentralized Recommendation Engine in the Social Internet of Things;In the Social Internet of Things (SIoT), the connected objects operate autonomously to request and provide information and services to end users. Following concepts and aspects from human social networks, the objects interact with each other, and over time develop trustworthy relationships. By mitigating security and privacy concerns, the benefit to end users is more effective and trustworthy services. In this work, we design a recommender system over SIoT. The recommender takes advantage of the social dynamics that drive the behavior and interactions of autonomous objects as they attempt to discover and return the best possible result. The main aim is to facilitate the optimum pairing of objects so as to enable effective recommendations.
Implementing IoT-Adaptive Fuzzy Neural Network Model Enabling Service for Supporting Fashion Retail;The fashion industry operates in a fast moving and dynamic environment which requires fashion designers to respond to market trends continuously. This study investigates potential for application of Internet of Things (IoT) in fashion retail. Customer in-store behaviors may reflect their hidden preferences. This study is based on use of IoT as a framework of data collection tools to capture customer behaviors in-store. Artificial intelligence (AI) such Fuzzy logic and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) are used to analyze customer purchasing intentions and simulation will be used to illustrate the model [1].This study shows that IoT can obtain the required data of customer behaviors and use AI to analyze the preferences. It can be used in-store to help salespersons to respond to customer needs faster and accurately. The data obtained after analyzing can be used in supply chain planning.
PrivateJobMatch: A Privacy-Oriented Deferred Multi-Match Recommender System for Stable Employment;Coordination failure reduces match quality among employers and candidates in the job market, resulting in a large number of unfilled positions and/or unstable, short-term employment. Centralized job search engines provide a platform that connects directly employers with job-seekers. However, they require users to disclose a significant amount of personal data, i.e., build a user profile, in order to provide meaningful recommendations. In this paper, we present PrivateJobMatch - a privacy-oriented deferred multi-match recommender system - which generates stable pairings while requiring users to provide only a partial ranking of their preferences. PrivateJobMatch explores a series of adaptations of the game-theoretic Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance algorithm which combine the flexibility of decentralized markets with the intelligence of centralized matching. We identify the shortcomings of the original algorithm when applied to a job market and propose novel solutions that rely on machine learning techniques. Experimental results on real and synthetic data confirm the benefits of the proposed algorithms across several quality measures. Over the past year, we have implemented a PrivateJobMatch prototype and deployed it in an active job market economy. Using the gathered real-user preference data, we find that the match recommendations are superior to a typical decentralized job market---while requiring only a partial ranking of the user preferences.
Representation Learning for Dynamic Graphs: A Survey;Graphs arise naturally in many real-world applications including social networks, recommender systems, ontologies, biology, and computational finance. Traditionally, machine learning models for graphs have been mostly designed for static graphs. However, many applications involve evolving graphs. This introduces important challenges for learning and inference since nodes, attributes, and edges change over time. In this survey, we review the recent advances in representation learning for dynamic graphs, including dynamic knowledge graphs. We describe existing models from an encoder-decoder perspective, categorize these encoders and decoders based on the techniques they employ, and analyze the approaches in each category. We also review several prominent applications and widely used datasets and highlight directions for future research.
Academic Social Network-Based Recommendation Approach for Knowledge Sharing;Academic information overload has brought researchers great difficulty due to the rapid growth of scientific articles. Methods have been proposed to help professional readers find relevant articles on the basis of their publications. Although effectively sharing publications is essential to spreading knowledge and ideas, few studies have focused on knowledge sharing from an author perspective. This study leverages the online academic social network to propose a recommendation approach for knowledge sharing. In our approach, we integrate researcher-level and document-level analyses in the same model. Our model works in two stages: 1) researcher-level analysis and 2) document-level analysis. The former combines research topic relevance, social relations, and research quality dimension, and the latter uses the machine learning method to learn the vector representation for each word. Online social behavior information is also leveraged to enhance readers' short-term interests. Our approach is deployed in ScholarMate, a prevalent academic social network. Compared with other baseline methods (CB, LDA, and part of the proposed approach), our approach significantly improves the accuracy of recommendations. Moreover, our method can disseminate papers efficiently to readers who have no publications.
Weighted Neural Collaborative Filtering: Deep Implicit Recommendation with Weighted Positive and Negative Feedback;Being able to generate personalized recommendations is a widespread objective in (online) retail. The focus of this research is to estimate the relevance of user-item combinations based on previous interactions using implicit feedback. We do this in a situation where interactions are often repeated, focusing on new ones. We bring two weighting schemes of positive and negative implicit feedback together into a single Weighted Matrix Factorization (WMF) model to handle the uncertainty associated with implicit preference information. Next, we bring the concept of these weighting schemes to a Deep Learning framework by introducing a Neural Weighted Matrix Factorization model (NeuWMF). We experiment with different weights, loss functions, and regularization terms, and evaluate both models using purchase data from an online supermarket. Our WMF model with both weighted positive and negative feedbacks gives superior performance in terms of NDCG and HR over regular WMF models. Even better results are obtained by our NeuWMF model, which is better capable of capturing the complex patterns behind item preferences. Especially the weighting of positive terms gives an extra boost compared to the state-of-the-art NeuMF model. We confirm the practical use of our model results in an experiment on real customer interactions.
A Recommender System for Heterogeneous and Time Sensitive Environment;The digital game industry has recently adopted recommender systems to deliver the most relevant content and suggest the most suitable activities to players. Because of diverse game designs and dynamic experiences, recommender systems typically operate in highly heterogeneous and time-sensitive environments. In this paper, we describe a recommender system at a digital game company which aims to provide recommendations for a large variety of use-cases while being easy to integrate and operate. The system leverages a unified data platform, standardized context and tracking data pipelines, robust naive linear contextual multi-armed bandit algorithms, and experimentation platform for extensibility as well as flexibility. Several games and applications have successfully launched with the recommender system and have achieved significant improvements.
Effects of Personalized and Aggregate Top-N Recommendation Lists on User Preference Ratings;Prior research has shown a robust effect of personalized product recommendations on user preference judgments for items. Specifically, the display of system-predicted preference ratings as item recommendations has been shown in multiple studies to bias users’ preference ratings after item consumption in the direction of the predicted rating. Top-N lists represent another common approach for presenting item recommendations in recommender systems. Through three controlled laboratory experiments, we show that top-N lists do not induce a discernible bias in user preference judgments. This result is robust, holding for both lists of personalized item recommendations and lists of items that are top-rated based on averages of aggregate user ratings. Adding numerical ratings to the list items does generate a bias, consistent with earlier studies. Thus, in contexts where preference biases are of concern to an online retailer or platform, top-N lists, without numerical predicted ratings, would be a promising format for displaying item recommendations.
Exact-K Recommendation via Maximal Clique Optimization;"This paper targets to a novel but practical recommendation problem named exact-K recommendation. It is different from traditional top-K recommendation, as it focuses more on (constrained) combinatorial optimization which will optimize to recommend a whole set of K items called card, rather than ranking optimization which assumes that ""better"" items should be put into top positions. Thus we take the first step to give a formal problem definition, and innovatively reduce it to Maximum Clique Optimization based on graph. To tackle this specific combinatorial optimization problem which is NP-hard, we propose Graph Attention Networks (GAttN) with a Multi-head Self-attention encoder and a decoder with attention mechanism. It can end-to-end learn the joint distribution of the K items and generate an optimal card rather than rank individual items by prediction scores. Then we propose Reinforcement Learning from Demonstrations (RLfD) which combines the advantages in behavior cloning and reinforcement learning, making it sufficient-and-efficient to train the model. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed GAttN with RLfD method, it outperforms several strong baselines with a relative improvement of 7.7% and 4.7% on average in Precision and Hit Ratio respectively, and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for the exact-K recommendation problem."
Balanced Order Batching with Task-Oriented Graph Clustering;"Balanced order batching problem (BOBP) arises from the process of warehouse picking in Cainiao, the largest logistics platform in China. Batching orders together in the picking process to form a single picking route, reduces travel distance. The reason for its importance is that order picking is a labor intensive process and, by using good batching methods, substantial savings can be obtained. The BOBP is a NP-hard combinational optimization problem and designing a good problem-specific heuristic under the quasi-real-time system response requirement is non-trivial. In this paper, rather than designing heuristics, we propose an end-to-end learning and optimization framework named Balanced Task-orientated Graph Clustering Network (BTOGCN) to solve the BOBP by reducing it to balanced graph clustering optimization problem. In BTOGCN, a task-oriented estimator network is introduced to guide the type-aware heterogeneous graph clustering networks to find a better clustering result related to the BOBP objective. Through comprehensive experiments on single-graph and multi-graphs, we show: 1) our balanced task-oriented graph clustering network can directly utilize the guidance of target signal and outperforms the two-stage deep embedding and deep clustering method; 2) our method obtains an average 4.57m and 0.13m picking distance reduction than the expert-designed algorithm on single and multi-graph set and has a good generalization ability to apply in practical scenario."
An Online Paper Recommendation System Driven by User's Interest Model and User Group;How to recommend appropriate papers to researchers based on their research interest has already attracted lots of attentions. A research interest model based on several historical behaviors is proposed. A reduction function is proposed to adjust the different influences of the behaviors, and then the user group with similar interests is created based on the interest model. Two paper recommendation methods are finally explored, which based on the user's research interests and on the user group, respectively. Experiments show that the proposed research interest model performs well.
Joint Neural Collaborative Filtering for Recommender Systems;We propose a Joint Neural Collaborative Filtering (J-NCF) method for recommender systems. The J-NCF model applies a joint neural network that couples deep feature learning and deep interaction modeling with a rating matrix. Deep feature learning extracts feature representations of users and items with a deep learning architecture based on a user-item rating matrix. Deep interaction modeling captures non-linear user-item interactions with a deep neural network using the feature representations generated by the deep feature learning process as input. J-NCF enables the deep feature learning and deep interaction modeling processes to optimize each other through joint training, which leads to improved recommendation performance. In addition, we design a new loss function for optimization that takes both implicit and explicit feedback, point-wise and pair-wise loss into account.Experiments on several real-world datasets show significant improvements of J-NCF over state-of-the-art methods, with improvements of up to 8.24% on the MovieLens 100K dataset, 10.81% on the MovieLens 1M dataset, and 10.21% on the Amazon Movies dataset in terms of HR@10. NDCG@10 improvements are 12.42%, 14.24%, and 15.06%, respectively. We also conduct experiments to evaluate the scalability and sensitivity of J-NCF. Our experiments show that the J-NCF model has a competitive recommendation performance with inactive users and different degrees of data sparsity when compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
Proposed Model of Academic Reading Material Recommendation System;Cold-start problem and cold-item are something that will happen when an early developed online library of educational institution library tries to recommend scientific articles to users. The reading materials do not even have reviews and/or ratings from previous users, no users have expressed preferences yet, also solely rely on keywords in search engines. The fact that there are abundant holdings in the library, it needs to effectively maintain users' interests to borrow and download academic reading material in accordance with users' interest from holdings in the library repository. This study seeks to provide novelty by finding another way to utilize dataset with only using abstract and title variables as an input parallelly that can provide effective results as a recommendation system. It proposes a word embedding model to be used as topic modeling for the content-based recommendation system to overcome the problems, wherein the attributes are minimum (such as title, author, and abstract) and user data are not available.
Applications of Big Data Analytics in Supply Chain Management: Findings from Expert Interviews;The increased amount of data being generated in virtually every context provides huge potential for a variety of organisational application fields, one of them being Supply Chain Management (SCM). The possibilities and use cases of applying this new type of data, i.e. Big Data (BD), is huge and a large body of research has already been conducted in this area. The current paper aims at identifying the understanding and the applications of BD not from an academic but a practitioners’ point of view. By applying expert interviews, the main aim is to identify (i) a definition of Big Data from SCM practitioners’ point of view, (ii) current SCM activities and processes where BD is already used in practice, (iii) potential future application fields for BD as seen in SCM practice and (iv) main hinderers of BD application. The results show that Big Data is referred to as complex data sets with high volumes and a variety of sources that can't be handled with traditional approaches and require data expert knowledge and SCM domain knowledge to be used in organisational practical. Current applications include the creation of transparency in logistics and SCM, the improvement of demand planning or the support of supplier quality management. The interviewed experts coincide in the view, that BD offers huge potential in future SCM. A shared vision was the implementation of real-time transparency of Supply Chains (SC), the ability to predict the behavior of SCs based on identified data patterns and the possibility to predict the impact of decisions on SCM before they are taken.
What Are Weak Links in the Npm Supply Chain?;Modern software development frequently uses third-party packages, raising the concern of supply chain security attacks. Many attackers target popular package managers, like npm, and their users with supply chain attacks. In 2021 there was a 650% year-on-year growth in security attacks by exploiting Open Source Software's supply chain. Proactive approaches are needed to predict package vulnerability to high-risk supply chain attacks. The goal of this work is to help software developers and security specialists in measuring npm supply chain weak link signals to prevent future supply chain attacks by empirically studying npm package metadata.In this paper, we analyzed the metadata of 1.63 million JavaScript npm packages. We propose six signals of security weaknesses in a software supply chain, such as the presence of install scripts, maintainer accounts associated with an expired email domain, and inactive packages with inactive maintainers. One of our case studies identified 11 malicious packages from the install scripts signal. We also found 2,818 maintainer email addresses associated with expired domains, allowing an attacker to hijack 8,494 packages by taking over the npm accounts. We obtained feedback on our weak link signals through a survey responded to by 470 npm package developers. The majority of the developers supported three out of our six proposed weak link signals. The developers also indicated that they would want to be notified about weak links signals before using third-party packages. Additionally, we discussed eight new signals suggested by package developers.
Dynamic Tensor Recommender Systems;Recommender systems have been extensively used by the entertainment industry, business marketing and the biomedical industry. In addition to its capacity of providing preference-based recommendations as an unsupervised learning methodology, it has been also proven useful in sales forecasting, product introduction and other production related businesses. Since some consumers and companies need a recommendation or prediction for future budget, labor and supply chain coordination, dynamic recommender systems for precise forecasting have become extremely necessary. In this article, we propose a new recommendation method, namely the dynamic tensor recommender system (DTRS), which aims particularly at forecasting future recommendation. The proposed method utilizes a tensor-valued function of time to integrate time and contextual information, and creates a time-varying coefficient model for temporal tensor factorization through a polynomial spline approximation. Major advantages of the proposed method include competitive future recommendation predictions and effective prediction interval estimations. In theory, we establish the convergence rate of the proposed tensor factorization and asymptotic normality of the spline coefficient estimator. The proposed method is applied to simulations, IRI marketing data and Last.fm data. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of future time forecasting.
Interpretable User Behavioral Analysis and Personalized Recommendation with Side Information;Due to information overload, recommender system is developed and widely applied to better predict customer behaviors empowered by interaction data. In this paper, we develop an interpretable recommender system to improve click behavior prediction accuracy. Our proposed recommender system consists of i) designing a user-item interaction rating system defined as the weighted-sum of the multiple interaction variables, where the weight vector is regarded as hyperparameter, ii) using matrix factorization technique to capture the latent structure from the observable user-item interaction, and predict personalized ratings for items not shown to users, and iii) determining the weight vector by optimizing AUC which evaluates click behavior prediction accuracy on a validation set. To be specific, an algorithm with radial basis function surrogates is applied for hyperparameter optimization. We also develop a case study with user behavioral data from Netease music and observe a 15.5% improvement in AUC when incorporating multiple information sources.

Collaborative-based web recommender system for homestay program: A Bridging tool in a tourism supply chain;Homestay Program (HP) initiatives play an important role in Community-based Tourism (CBT), especially for Malaysian tourism industry. HPs offer activities that are catalysts to the community development, focusing those in the rural areas. However, due to technological advancements, promotion and marketing strategy for the unique CBT initiative needs a new and inventive move. This leads to the proposed technology-based framework for a system as part of the specific CBT supply chain (CBTSC), known as the Collaborative-based Web Recommender (CBWR) system or simply, website. The CBTSC is further intensified to emerge the CBWR sub-supply chain model. As part of the CBWR model, the CBWR website is able to essentially promote the CBT effort of HP worldwide, thus supports community development and livelihood. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.
Who Needs to Know What, When?: Broadening the Explainable AI (XAI) Design Space by Looking at Explanations Across the AI Lifecycle;The interpretability or explainability of AI systems (XAI) has been a topic gaining renewed attention in recent years across AI and HCI communities. Recent work has drawn attention to the emergent explainability requirements of in situ, applied projects, yet further exploratory work is needed to more fully understand this space. This paper investigates applied AI projects and reports on a qualitative interview study of individuals working on AI projects at a large technology and consulting company. Presenting an empirical understanding of the range of stakeholders in industrial AI projects, this paper also draws out the emergent explainability practices that arise as these projects unfold, highlighting the range of explanation audiences (who), as well as how their explainability needs evolve across the AI project lifecycle (when). We discuss the importance of adopting a sociotechnical lens in designing AI systems, noting how the “AI lifecycle” can serve as a design metaphor to further the XAI design field.
